Understanding how energetic particles are transported in the heliosphere (and accelerated) remains one of the central problems in space physics & astrophysics. Despite decades of research, many long-standing questions persist.

- solar energetic particles (SEPs)
- cosmic ray (CRs)

Parker transport equation (TE) [@parkerPassageEnergeticCharged1965]:

$$
\frac{∂ f}{∂ t}=\frac{∂}{∂ x_i}\left[κ_{i j} \frac{∂ f}{∂ x_j}\right]-U_i \frac{∂ f}{∂ x_i}-V_{d, i} \frac{∂ f}{∂ x_i}+\frac{1}{3} \frac{∂ U_i}{∂ x_i}\left[\frac{∂ f}{∂ \ln p}\right]+ \text{Sources} - \text{Losses},
$$ {#eq-parker}

However, these frameworks struggle to explain all the dynamics observed.


### Dropouts

![time profiles of lowenergy He ion intensities recorded by the Wind/LEMT sensor showing a gradual SEP event beginning on 1997 November 6. A dropout in ion intensity lasting about 2 hr can be seen during the decay phase of the gradual event. [@tanTurbulentOriginsParticle2023]](./figures/tanTurbulentOriginsParticle2023-fig1b.png)

### Reservoir

A region where the intensities and energy spectra throughout much of the inner heliosphere (see Fig. 52: top right panel) at different azimuthal, radial, and latitudinal locations are nearly identical

![Intensity-time profiles for protons in the 1979 March 1 event at 3 spacecraft are shown in the upper left panel with times of shock passage indicated by S for each. Energy spectra in the “reservoir” at time R are shown in the upper right panel while the paths of the spacecraft through a sketch of the CME are shown below [@reamesTwoSourcesSolar2013]](figures/reamesTwoSourcesSolar2013-fig6.png)
