## Part 0: Research Context and Background

> “ You don’t have to know everything. You simply need to know where to find it when necessary. ” - John Brunner

Understanding how energetic particles are transported in the heliosphere (and accelerated) remains one of the central problems in space physics & astrophysics. Despite decades of research, many long-standing questions persist.

- solar energetic particles (SEPs)
- cosmic ray (CRs)

Parker transport equation (TE) [@parkerPassageEnergeticCharged1965]:

$$
\frac{∂ f}{∂ t}=\frac{∂}{∂ x_i}\left[κ_{i j} \frac{∂ f}{∂ x_j}\right]-U_i \frac{∂ f}{∂ x_i}-V_{d, i} \frac{∂ f}{∂ x_i}+\frac{1}{3} \frac{∂ U_i}{∂ x_i}\left[\frac{∂ f}{∂ \ln p}\right]+ \text{Sources} - \text{Losses},
$$ {#eq-parker}

It captures four main transport processes:

- spatial diffusion (particle scattering)
- advection with the solar wind
- drifts (such as gradient and curvature drifts)
- adiabatic energy change

However, these frameworks struggle to explain all the dynamics observed.

### Dropouts

A dropout in ion intensity lasting about 2 hr can be seen during the decay phase of the gradual event. [@tanTurbulentOriginsParticle2023]](./figures/tanTurbulentOriginsParticle2023-fig1b.png)

![dropout period having $θ_{BV} \sim 0°$](./figures/tanTurbulentOriginsParticle2023-fig4.png)

### Reservoir

A region where the intensities and energy spectra throughout much of the inner heliosphere (see Fig. 52: top right panel) at different azimuthal, radial, and latitudinal locations are nearly identical

### Turbulent Magnetic Fluctuations


![PDF of the out-of-plane electric current density $J_z$ from a 2D MHD simulation, compared to a reference Gaussian (standard deviation $σ$). For each region I, II, and III, magnetic field lines (contours of constant magnetic potential $A_z$: > 0 solid, < 0 dashed) are shown; the colored (red) regions are places where the selected band (I, II, or III) contributes. [@grecoPartialVarianceIncrements2017]](./figures/grecoPartialVarianceIncrements2017-fig1.png)

::: {.notes}
A physically appealing interpretation emerges: region I consists of very low values of fluctuations that lie mainly in the lanes between magnetic islands. Region II consists of sub-Gaussian current cores that populate the central regions of the magnetic islands (or flux tubes). Region III is composed of the coherent small-scale current sheet-like structures that form the sharp boundaries between the magnetic flux tubes. This classification provides a real-space picture of the nature of intermittent MHD turbulence.

### The Role of Current Sheets in Particle Transport

![Trajectories of three particles of 1 MeV SEP interaction with switchback (two SDWs shown by red dashed lines) @malaraEnergeticParticleDynamics2023](./figures/malaraEnergeticParticleDynamics2023-fig8.png)

### Main Scientific Objective

Motivation / Gap : No prior studies systematically characterize particle interactions with solar wind current sheets 

Quantitative understanding of how these structures influence energetic particles transport

This objective leads to two main tasks:  

1. Observational characterization of solar wind current sheets across the heliosphere
2. Development of data-driven theoretical models for current sheet-induced particle scattering and transport

## Part 1: Observational Analysis of Current Sheets

> “ Wanderer, there is no path the path is forged as you wander. ” - Antonio Machado

### What are the properties of current sheets that are most relevant to particle transport? 

Similar to the role of turbulence level, spectral index, anisotropy and intermittency in turbulence transport models

As a first-order model, we use a simple magnetic field configuration:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{B} &= B_0 (\cos θ \ \mathbf{e_z} + \sin θ ( \sin φ(z) \ \mathbf{e_x} + \cos φ (z) \ \mathbf{e_y})) 
\\
φ(z) &= β \tanh(z/L)
\end{aligned}
$$

### Hamiltonian formalism

The motion of particle after simplification and normalization:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\tilde{H} &= \frac{1}{2} \left(\left(\tilde{p_x}-f_1(z)\right)^2+\left(\tilde{x} \cot θ + f_2(z)\right)^2+\tilde{p_z}^2\right)
\\
f_1(z) &=\frac{1}{2} \cos β \ \left(\text{Ci}\left(βs_+(z)  \right)-\text{Ci}\left(βs_-(z)\right)\right) +  \frac{1}{2} \sin β \ \left(\text{Si}\left(βs_+(z) \right)-\text{Si}\left(βs_-(z)\right)\right),
\\
f_2(z) &=\frac{1}{2}  \sin β \ \left(\text{Ci}\left(β s_+(z) \right)+\text{Ci}\left(β s_-(z)\right)\right) -\frac{1}{2} \cos β \ \left(\text{Si}\left(β s_+(z)  \right)+\text{Si}\left(β s_-(z)\right)\right)
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-Hamiltonian}

Four key parameters: 

- Occurrence rate
- Shear angle $\beta$ => $J_m = - \frac{1}{\mu_0 V_n} \frac{d B_l}{d t}$ Current density
- Normal direction $θ$
- Current sheet thickness (compared to the particle gyroradius)

![Example of a current sheet observed by ARTEMIS. Top: magnetic field in the current sheet $\textbf{lmn}$ coordinate system where $l$ represents the maximum variance direcction ($B_x=B_t\sin φ$ in our model), $m$ the intermediate variance direction ($B_y=B_t\cos φ$), and $n$ the minimum variance direction ($B_z=B_0\cos θ$). Here, $B_t$ and $B_0$ represent the tangential and total magnetic fields, respectively. Bottom: variations of the azimuthal angle $φ$ and the azimuthal angle $θ$ across the current sheet.

### What do we know about these parameters across the heliosphere?

Past studies [@sodingRadialLatitudinalDependencies2001, @lotekarKineticscaleCurrentSheets2022, @liuCharacteristicsInterplanetaryDiscontinuities2021, @vaskoKineticscaleCurrentSheets2022, @vaskoKineticScaleCurrentSheets2024] often lacked simultaneous multi-point measurements, employed different identification and quantification methods, and did not sufficiently separate temporal variability from spatial trends—contributing to significant uncertainties.

From inner heliosphere (Parker Solar Probe, PSP) to 1 AU (ARTEMIS, Wind) to outer heliosphere (Juno).

### Results and Implications

- solar wind current sheets maintain kinetic-scale thicknesses throughout the inner heliosphere
- normalized thickness and current density remain nearly constant over the range from 0.1 to 5 AU
- occurrence rates decreases approximately as $1/r$ with radial distance between 1 and 5 AU (geometric effect)

## Part 2: Quantitative Modeling of Particle Scattering

> In physics, you don't have to go around making trouble for yourself – nature does it for you.   - Frank Wilczek

**Question**: What is the specific role of coherent structures—particularly current sheets—in shaping scattering processes (as a function of particle energy and current sheet geometry)?

**Approach:** Combined statistical measurements of current sheets at 1 AU with a Hamiltonian analytical framework and test particle simulations.


$$
\tilde{H} = \frac{1}{2} \left(\left(\tilde{p_x}-f_1(z)\right)^2+\left(\tilde{x} \cot θ + f_2(z)\right)^2+\tilde{p_z}^2\right)
$$

## Part 1.5: Multifluid Model for Current Sheet Alfvénicity

> The goal of physics is to find the simplest possible description that accounts for all observations.

**Question**: Why do current sheets appear increasingly non-Alfvénic with distance, despite their force-free magnetic structure?

$$
\left(\sum_α Γ_α m_α\right) Δ v_{A,x} = \sqrt{\sum_α  m_α n_α(∞) \sum_α\frac{m_α Γ_α^2 }{n_α(∞)}} ΔU_x
$$ {#eq-vRatio}

where $Γ_α = n_α u_{αz}$ is constant parameter from the conservation of fluid mass.

- For a single-fluid plasma, this expression reduces to the simpler $\Delta v_{A,x}=\Delta U_x$ f
- For two counter-streaming ion fluids with $m_1 = m_2, u_{z,1}(∞) = -u_{z,2}(∞)$, the above expression can be further simplified to:

$$
|n_1(∞) - n_2(∞)|  Δ v_{A,x}  =   (n_1(∞) +  n_2(∞)) ΔU_x

## Part 3: Proposed Research

> “ But still try, for who knows what is possible? ” - Michael Faraday

The total time between two consecutive current sheet encounters is modeled as the sum of the time spent inside the current sheet $T_{cs}$, and the time spent free-streaming between sheets $T_{fs}$, given by:

$$
T = T_{cs} + T_{fs}, \quad T_{fs} = \frac{s_{fs}}{|v_{∥,1}|}
$$

where $v_{∥,0}$, $v_{∥,1}$ are the particle's changed parallel velocity before and after interacting with the current sheet, respectively.

In the absence of scattering, the particle would follow the field line and travel a distance:

$$
s_0 = |v_{∥,0}| \cdot T = |v_{∥,0}| \left( T_{cs} + \frac{s_{fs}}{|v_{∥,1}|} \right).
$$

However, when scattering occurs, the total distance traveled becomes:

$$
s = s_{cs}^* + \text{sign}\left(\frac{v_{∥,1}}{v_{∥,0}}\right) s_{fs} \approx \text{sign}\left(\frac{v_{∥,1}}{v_{∥,0}}\right) s_{fs}
$$

under the approximation that $s_{cs}^* << s_{fs}$, where $s_{cs}^*$ is the effective parallel distance the particle travels within the current sheet. The net displacement compared to the unperturbed case is then:

$$
Δ s_∥ = s - s_0 = s_{fs} \left(\text{sign}\left(\frac{v_{∥,1}}{v_{∥,0}}\right) - \frac{|v_{∥,0}|}{|v_{∥,1}|} \right) - |v_{∥,0}| T_{cs}
$$

The parallel spatial diffusion coefficient is then expressed as:

$$
κ_∥ = \frac{(Δ s_∥)^2}{Δ t}
$$

Similarly, for the perpendicular direction:

$$
κ_\perp = \frac{(Δ s_\perp)^2}{T_{cs} + | s_{fs} / v_{∥,1} |}.
$$
