## Motivation and Significance (Summary)

Solar energetic particles (SEPs), originating from solar flares and coronal mass ejections, pose significant risks to satellite operations, human spaceflight, and communication systems. Accurate prediction of SEP events and their propagation through the heliosphere requires a detailed understanding of particle transport mechanisms in turbulent solar wind environments. 

Traditionally, theoretical studies and numerical models of particle transport in the solar wind have focused on turbulence characterized by broadband, low-amplitude, random-phase magnetic fluctuations described by power-law spectra [@jokipiiCosmicRayPropagationCharged1966; @jokipiiCosmicRayPropagationIi1967]. However, observations consistently reveal the abundance of intermittent, meso-scale, coherent structures within this turbulent medium, notably current sheets‚Äîthin plasma boundaries marked by abrupt magnetic field changes. These current sheets deviate significantly from classical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) picture due to their kinetic-scale features and strong local magnetic gradients.

Recent theoretical and numerical studies suggest that these coherent structures play a critical role in particle scattering, potentially surpassing the scattering efficiencies predicted by traditional quasilinear theories [@malaraChargedparticleChaoticDynamics2021; @artemyevSuperfastIonScattering2020]. Current sheets, generated naturally through nonlinear turbulence cascades, provide localized regions of intense electromagnetic interactions, leading to enhanced scattering and modification of the particle's spatial distribution. Despite their demonstrated importance, a quantitative and systematic understanding of how these structures influence SEP transport remains incomplete.

Addressing this critical gap, this dissertation aims to rigorously investigate and quantify the impact of solar wind current sheets on SEP transport processes. Specifically, this research seeks to:

1. Characterize the properties and occurrence of current sheets throughout different regions of the heliosphere.
2. Develop and validate theoretical models that describe particle scattering induced by these coherent structures.
3. Provide a more comprehensive understanding of SEP dynamics, thereby improving predictive capabilities and contributing significantly to space weather modeling.

The motivation for this research lies in the critical need for improved SEP transport models that accurately reflect real-world solar wind conditions. By integrating observational data and advanced theoretical frameworks, this dissertation will provide novel insights into heliospheric particle dynamics, ultimately enhancing our ability to predict and mitigate the risks associated with SEP events.

## Research Context and Background

The study of solar energetic particles [@kleinAccelerationPropagationSolar2017; @desaiLargeGradualSolar2016; @reamesTwoSourcesSolar2013], turbulent magnetic fields [@schekochihinMHDTurbulenceBiased2022; @matthaeusTurbulenceSpacePlasmas2021; @oughtonSolarWindTurbulence2021; @brunoTurbulenceSolarWind2016;@brunoSolarWindTurbulence2013; @verscharenMultiscaleNatureSolar2019; @tuMHDStructuresWaves1995], and charged particle transport [@engelbrechtTheoryCosmicRay2022; @vandenbergPrimerFocusedSolar2020] has produced a vast body of literature spanning decades of theoretical, observational, and numerical research. Within this context, current sheets have increasingly been recognized as key structures. In the following sections, we highlight a selection of foundational observations, models, and theoretical developments that are directly or indirectly connected to the role of current sheets. These include both classical frameworks and recent advances that point to the importance of coherent structures in turbulent plasmas. In @sec-cs, we summarize how a deeper understanding of current sheets can enhance our ability to model energetic particle transport and, more broadly, improve our understanding of heliospheric particle dynamics.

### Solar Energetic Particles

Solar energetic particles (SEPs) are high-energy ions and electrons originating at or near the Sun. They span a broad energy spectrum, from Solar energetic particles (SEPs) consist of high-energy ions and electrons originating at or near the Sun. Unlike the solar wind and galactic cosmic rays (GCRs), solar energetic particles (SEPs) manifest as discrete episodic events  with intensities that can vary dramatically‚Äîby several orders of magnitude‚Äîin just minutes. Additionally, SEP events exhibit significant variations in heavy ion composition, spectral shape, and spatial distribution. 

SEPs are primarily accelerated through two distinct mechanisms: (1) magnetic reconnection-driven processes during solar flares, producing impulsive SEP events, and (2) shock-wave acceleration associated with fast coronal mass ejections (CMEs), resulting in large gradual SEP events.

Impulsive SEP events typically have short durations, lasting from minutes to a few hours, and feature characteristically high electron-to-proton ratios and enrichments of heavy ions. In contrast, gradual SEP events are longer-lasting (several days) and are predominantly proton-rich, often associated with fast CMEs driving shocks in the solar corona and interplanetary space. These shocks accelerate particles over extended regions, producing widespread and intense radiation storms.

### Turbulent Magnetic Fluctuations

Solar wind turbulence spans scales from the large‚Äëscale coherence length (‚àº0.01‚ÄØAU) down to kinetic dissipation scales on the order of the thermal ion gyro‚Äëradius (‚àº100‚ÄØkm). Of particular importance for energetic particle transport is the turbulence at intermediate scales, often referred to as inertial-range turbulence whose corresponding energy range is about $1$ GeV to $1$ keV assuming a $5$ nT magnetic field. This covers nearly all SEPs as the gyro-radii of almost all SEPs are smaller than the coherence scale and larger than the dissipation scale.

The transport of SEPs through the heliosphere is fundamentally shaped by the properties of magnetic turbulence.  Key parameters‚Äîsuch as the spatial inhomogeneity, turbulence level ($Œ¥B/B‚ÇÄ$), spectral index, and anisotropy of wave vectors [@pucciEnergeticParticleTransport2016] ‚Äîstrongly influence how particles scatter in velocity space. These properties govern both parallel and perpendicular transport through mechanisms including pitch-angle diffusion, magnetic field-line meandering, and gradient or curvature drift.

Classical scattering theories and numerical models of particle transport [@giacaloneTransportCosmicRays1999] typically model turbulence as a sea of random, phase-uncorrelated fluctuations (common constructions of magnetic fluctuations for the slab component $Œ¥ùêÅ^s$ and two-dimensional component $Œ¥ùêÅ^{2D}$ are shown below in @eq-Œ¥ùêÅ). However, this idealized view neglects the intricate internal nonlinear structures of turbulence. Increasingly, observations and simulations show that solar wind turbulence is highly intermittent and populated with coherent structures‚Äîespecially current sheets‚Äîthat arise naturally through nonlinear cascade processes. These localized structures, often characterized by sharp magnetic field gradients, can trigger rapid and large pitch-angle deflections in energetic particles, significantly enhancing scattering beyond quasilinear predictions.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& Œ¥ùêÅ^s=\sum_{n=1}^{N_m} A_n\left[\cos \alpha_n\left(\cos \phi_n \hat{x}+\sin \phi_n \hat{y}\right)+i \sin \alpha_n(-\right.\left.\left.\sin \phi_n \hat{x}+\cos \phi_n \hat{y}\right)\right] \\
& \times \exp \left(i k_n z+i \beta_n\right) \\
& Œ¥ùêÅ^{2 D}=\sum_{n=1}^{N_m} A_n i\left(-\sin \phi_n \hat{x}+\cos \phi_n \hat{y}\right) \\
& \times \exp \left[i k_n\left(\cos \phi_n x+\sin \phi_n y\right)+i \beta_n\right]
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-Œ¥ùêÅ}

Therefore, understanding SEP transport requires more than bulk statistical descriptions of turbulence; it demands detailed knowledge of its intermittent nature and the embedded coherent structures that mediate particle scattering. Accurately characterizing these features is essential for developing realistic models of SEP propagation throughout the heliosphere.

### Charged Particle Transport and Turbulence Transport Models

The large-scale behavior of energetic charged particles in the heliosphere is commonly described using a diffusive approximation, justified when the particle scattering time is short compared to the timescale of interest. Under this assumption, the evolution of an approximately isotropic particle distribution is governed by the Parker transport equation [@parkerPassageEnergeticCharged1965]. This foundational framework captures four main transport processes: spatial diffusion due to particle scattering, advection with the solar wind, drifts (such as gradient and curvature drifts due to variations in the large-scale magnetic field), and adiabatic energy change:

$$
\frac{‚àÇ f}{‚àÇ t}=\frac{‚àÇ}{‚àÇ x_i}\left[Œ∫_{i j} \frac{‚àÇ f}{‚àÇ x_j}\right]-U_i \frac{‚àÇ f}{‚àÇ x_i}-V_{d, i} \frac{‚àÇ f}{‚àÇ x_i}+\frac{1}{3} \frac{‚àÇ U_i}{‚àÇ x_i}\left[\frac{‚àÇ f}{‚àÇ \ln p}\right]+ \text{Sources} - \text{Losses},
$$ {#eq-parker}

where $f$ is the phase-space distribution as a function of the particle momentum, $p$, position, $x_i$, and time, $t$; $Œ∫_{i j}$ is the symmetric part of the diffusion tensor; $U_i$ is the bulk plasma velocity; $V_{d, i}$ is the drift velocity. The drift velocity can be formally derived from the guiding center approximation averaged over a nearly isotropic distribution, and can be included as the antisymmetric part of the diffusion tensor. 

The symmetric diffusion tensor can be decomposed into components parallel and perpendicular to the mean magnetic field using: $Œ∫_{ij}=Œ∫_{\perp} \delta_{ij}-\frac{\left(Œ∫_{\perp}-Œ∫_{\|}\right) B_i B_j}{B^2}$. The parallel diffusion coefficient, $Œ∫_{\|}$, is related to the pitch-angle diffusion coefficient $D_{\mu\mu}$ through the quasilinear theory (QLT) framework [@jokipiiCosmicRayPropagationCharged1966; @jokipiiAddendumErratumCosmicRay1968] as $Œ∫_{\|}=\frac{v^2}{8} \int_{-1}^1 \frac{\left(1-\mu^2\right)^2}{D_{\mu \mu}(\mu)} d \mu$. 
While parallel transport is relatively well understood, perpendicular (cross-field) diffusion ($Œ∫_\perp$) remains more elusive due to its nonlinear and non-resonant nature [@shalchiPerpendicularDiffusionEnergetic2021; @costaCrossfieldDiffusionEnergetic2013]. A key factor influencing cross-field transport is the dimensionality of the turbulence [@giacaloneChargedParticleMotionMultidimensional1994]: in models with at least one ignorable spatial coordinate (e.g., slab geometry), cross-field diffusion is artificially suppressed, failing to capture essential physics. In general, cross-field transport arises from two distinct mechanisms: (1) particle motion along stochastic, meandering magnetic field lines, which can lead to substantial displacements relative to the mean field direction; and (2) the true decorrelation of particles from their initial field lines, allowing them to effectively jump between neighboring lines. Though often considered a small fraction of $Œ∫_\parallel$ [@giacaloneTransportCosmicRays1999], recent simulations reveal that $Œ∫_\perp$ can be significant and strongly dependent on particle energy and turbulence structure [@dundovicNovelAspectsCosmic2020].

Anisotropy in particle distributions is common in SEP events, particularly in the early phases or near upstream regions of interplanetary shocks. One fundamental source of anisotropy is adiabatic focusing in a diverging magnetic field. To account for such effects, the focused transport equation [@roelofPropagationSolarCosmic1969; @earlEffectAdiabaticFocusing1976] extends the Parker equation by explicitly retaining the pitch-angle dependence:

$$
\frac{‚àÇ f}{‚àÇ t}+\mu v \frac{‚àÇ f}{‚àÇ z}+\frac{v}{2 L}\left(1-\mu^2\right) \frac{‚àÇ f}{‚àÇ \mu}=\frac{‚àÇ}{‚àÇ \mu}\left(D_{\mu \mu} \frac{‚àÇ f}{‚àÇ \mu}\right)
$$

where $f= f(z,\mu,t)$ is the phase-space distribution, $\mu$ is the pitch-angle cosine and $L = -B \left(\frac{dB}{dz}\right)^{-1}$ is the focusing length.

Beyond classical diffusion, observations in SEP events and near interplanetary shocks often reveal anomalous transport behavior [@zimbardoSuperdiffusiveSubdiffusiveTransport2006], characterized by subdiffusive or superdiffusive scaling of particle displacement [@zimbardoSuperdiffusiveTransportLaboratory2015]. These deviations from Gaussian diffusion are attributed to the intermittent and structured nature of solar wind turbulence, and are better described using generalized frameworks such as fractional diffusion models [@del-castillo-negreteNondiffusiveTransportPlasma2005] or L√©vy statistics [@zaburdaevLevyWalks2015].

### Current sheet's role in particle transport {#sec-cs}

Across all major transport models, current sheets emerge as a critical feature influencing energetic particle dynamics. In the Parker equation framework, current sheets modify the pitch-angle scattering rate and hence directly affect $\kappa_\parallel$. In the context of the focused transport equation, they introduce strong pitch-angle dependencies and rapid scattering events. Moreover, current sheets can induce memory effects that violate the Markov assumption [@zimbardoNonMarkovianPitchangleScattering2020] of classical diffusion models and contribute to anomalous diffusion regimes.

These structures also challenge the conventional picture of diffusion. For parallel transport, the intense magnetic shear and sharp field gradients in current sheets can induce nonlinear effects, producing pitch-angle jumps that are too large to be treated as diffusive. For perpendicular transport, it is often assumed that field-line random walk dominates cross-field motion, as the magnetic field is typically smooth on scales comparable to SEP gyro-radii. However, near current sheets, the magnetic field becomes highly inhomogeneous‚Äîoften varying on scales similar to or smaller than the gyro-radius‚Äîthus enabling enhanced particle transfer between field lines and more significant perpendicular diffusion.

Because of their coherent, localized nature and their ability to shape both pitch-angle and spatial scattering processes, current sheets play a central role in accurately modeling particle transport in the turbulent heliospheric environment.

<!-- ### Current Sheets in the Solar Wind

Current sheets are characterized by sharp gradients in the magnetic field and plasma properties. Observational studies from spacecraft missions such as Wind, ARTEMIS, and Parker Solar Probe (PSP) consistently detect these structures throughout the heliosphere, from near-Sun regions (~0.1 AU) to the outer heliosphere (~5 AU).

These sheets often exhibit non-ideal behaviors, with kinetic processes such as magnetic reconnection and wave-particle interactions playing essential roles. Understanding the kinetic-scale dynamics within current sheets is therefore vital to fully characterize their impact on particle transport. -->

## Objectives and Thesis Plan

The overall goal of this thesis is to quantify and model the impact of solar wind current sheets on energetic particle transport. This research is structured around two primary objectives:

- Observational characterization of solar wind current sheets across the heliosphere

- Development of data-driven theoretical models for current sheet-induced particle scattering and transport

## Work Completed

### Observational Analysis of Current Sheets

**Context:** A critical first step in understanding the role of current sheets in energetic particle transport is to characterize their statistical properties and quantify the parameters most relevant to particle scattering. Although current sheets have been extensively observed‚Äîespecially near $1$ AU‚Äîour knowledge of how their properties evolve across heliocentric distances, and how key scattering-related parameters vary with radial distance, has remained incomplete. Previous studies often lacked simultaneous, multi-point measurements and did not adequately separate temporal variability from spatial trends, leading to persistent uncertainties regarding the role in particle transport, their origin, evolution within the turbulent solar wind.

**Approach:** To bridge this observational gap, we conducted a detailed statistical analysis using continuous solar wind data from multiple spacecraft: Parker Solar Probe (PSP) at distances down to 0.1 AU, Wind, ARTEMIS, and STEREO at 1 AU, and Juno during its cruise phase out to 5 AU near Jupiter. This combination allowed us to track the evolution of current sheet properties across a wide radial distance, from near Alfv√©nic critical surface to the outer inner heliosphere.

![Current sheets detected by PSP, Juno, STEREO and near-Earth ARTEMIS satellite: red, blue, and black lines are $ùêµ_ùëô$, $ùêµ_ùëö$, and $ùêµ$](figures/fig-ids_examples.png)

**Results:** Our analysis reveals that solar wind discontinuities maintain kinetic-scale thicknesses throughout the inner heliosphere, with occurrence rates decreasing approximately as $1/r$ with radial distance between 1 and 5 AU. When normalized to the local ion inertial length and Alfv√©n current, both the current density and thickness of these structures remain nearly constant over the range from 0.1 to 5 AU (see @fig-juno-distribution-r-sw). This suggests that current sheets consistently influence energetic particle transport across heliocentric distances, with their higher occurrence rates closer to the Sun indicating a more pronounced role in shaping particle dynamics in the inner heliosphere. Furthermore, by leveraging simultaneous observations from spacecraft at different radial distances, we demonstrate that the observed radial trends reflect genuine spatial evolution rather than temporal or solar-cycle effects. In particular, we propose a new interpretation of the reduced occurrence rate of current sheets at larger distances as being partly due to a geometric effect‚Äînamely, the decreasing likelihood of spacecraft intersecting inclined structures at greater heliocentric distances.

Together, these results provide critical empirical constraints for particle transport modeling and establish a robust observational foundation for the theoretical and numerical components of this thesis.

### Quantitative Modeling of Particle Scattering

**Context:** While it is well established that turbulence governs energetic particle transport in the heliosphere, the specific role of coherent structures‚Äîparticularly current sheets‚Äîin shaping scattering processes remained poorly quantified. A central objective of this thesis was to develop a physics-based, observation-informed model that directly links solar wind current sheet properties to pitch-angle scattering rates of energetic particles.

**Approach:** To this end, we combined statistical measurements of current sheets at 1 AU with a Hamiltonian analytical framework and test particle simulations to investigate how particle scattering efficiency varies with current sheet geometry and particle energy, using a realistic magnetic field configuration:

$$
\mathbf{B} = B_0 (\cos Œ∏ \ \mathbf{e_z} + \sin Œ∏ ( \sin œÜ(z) \ \mathbf{e_x} + \cos œÜ (z) \ \mathbf{e_y})) 
$$

where $B_0$ is the magnitude of the magnetic field, $Œ∏$ is the azimuthal angle between the normal and the magnetic field, and $œÜ(z)$ is the rotation profile of the magnetic field as a function of $z$.

**Results:** Using a newly formulated Hamiltonian framework (see dimensionless form in Equation @eq-Hamiltonian) that incorporates the effects of magnetic field shear angle $\beta$ and particle energy $H$, we demonstrate that scattering rates depend strongly on the current density‚Äîwhich is directly tied to $\beta$‚Äîas well as on the ratio of the particle gyroradius to the current sheet thickness (see @fig-uc-length). Notably, our results show that current sheets can induce rapid, non-diffusive pitch-angle jumps, particularly for SEPs in the 100 keV to 1 MeV energy ranges (see @fig-example-subset). This behavior deviates significantly from classical quasilinear predictions and highlights the need to account for coherent structures in transport models. To describe long-term pitch-angle evolution, we developed a simplified probabilistic model of pitch-angle scattering due to current sheets and derived an effective pitch-angle diffusion coefficient $D_{\mu\mu}$ (see @fig-mixing-rate).

These findings enables direct comparison with other scattering mechanisms, facilitates the incorporation of SWD-induced scattering into global SEP transport models, and directly support the broader goal of this thesis: to improve our understanding of how energetic particles interact with turbulence in the solar wind.

### Multifuid Model for Current Sheet Alfv√©nicity

**Context:** Early in this thesis, we identified a consistent radial trend in the Alfv√©nicity of solar wind current sheets‚Äîdefined as the ratio of the plasma velocity jump to the Alfv√©n speed jump. While current sheets near the Sun exhibit high Alfv√©nicity, this value systematically decreases with increasing heliocentric distance. This raised a fundamental question: why do current sheets appear increasingly non-Alfv√©nic with distance, despite their force-free magnetic structure? Understanding the internal structure, stability, and evolution of current sheets is crucial, as it directly relates to their role in modulating the transport of energetic particles across the heliosphere.

**Approach:** While classical single-fluid MHD models, even when extended to include pressure anisotropy, provide useful insights, they fall short of capturing the full physical complexity observed in current sheets. A natural and necessary extension is to adopt a multifluid framework, which allows for a more realistic treatment of multiple ion populations.

**Results:** To address this challenge, we developed a multifluid theoretical model that includes both a nonzero normal magnetic field and a guide field, and explicitly accounts for the dynamics of counter-streaming ion populations (see @fig-profiles). The model reveals a clear physical interpretation: close to the Sun, current sheets are dominated by a single ion population, leading to high Alfv√©nicity, while at larger radial distances, the ion populations become more balanced, resulting in reduced Alfv√©nicity (see @fig-velocity-profiles). By bridging the gap between overly simplified single-fluid models and fully kinetic treatments, this multifluid model offers a physically consistent and computationally tractable framework. It establishes a critical connection between the macroscopic evolution of current sheets and the microscopic processes relevant to energetic particle scattering‚Äîthus advancing the broader thesis goal of modeling SEP transport in a realistic, structure-rich solar wind.

### Software Development

**Context**: A central requirement for this thesis was the ability to perform high-performance, interactive, and reproducible analysis of space plasma data and particle dynamics. While the established SPEDAS framework‚Äîoriginally developed in IDL and later ported to Python‚Äîremains widely used in the community, its design limitations hinder modern scientific workflows.

**Approach**: To address this, we developed a suite of Julia-based software tools that combine the flexibility and speed of a modern language with the functionality of legacy systems.

**Results**: The core of this framework is `SPEDAS.jl`, which has interfaces directly with [`pyspedas`](https://github.com/spedas/pyspedas), [`speasy`](https://github.com/SciQLop/speasy), and [`HAPI`](https://hapi-server.org/) while introducing new routines with significantly improved performance. To enable efficient test-particle tracing in both analytic and numerical electromagnetic fields, we developed `TestParticle.jl`, a lightweight tool for rapid particle trajectory simulations. Additionally, we created [`SpaceDataModel.jl`](https://github.com/beforerr/SpaceDataModel.jl) to implement flexible, standards-compliant data structures aligned with SPASE and HAPI specifications, and contributed physics utilities through [`ChargedParticles.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaPlasma/ChargedParticles.jl) and [`PlasmaFormulary.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaPlasma/PlasmaFormulary.jl). These tools have been integral to the data analysis, modeling, and simulation components of this thesis, enabling scalable and transparent research workflows essential for studying particle transport in the heliosphere.

## Proposed Research Direction

### Spatial Diffusion Model Refinement

Building on previous results, the next phase of research will extend the pitch-angle scattering framework to comprehensively model spatial diffusion processes (both parallel and perpendicular). This extension is crucial for accurately capturing the full scope of SEP transport influenced by current sheets.

### Methodology

**Analysis:** To estimate the spatial diffusion coefficients parallel and perpendicular to the mean magnetic field, we must quantify the net displacement a particle experiences due to interactions with consecutive current sheets. This includes estimating the parallel and perpendicular displacements, $\Delta s_\parallel$ and $\Delta s_\perp$, over the duration of one interaction cycle.

The total time between two consecutive current sheet encounters is modeled as the sum of the time spent inside the current sheet $T_{cs}$, and the time spent free-streaming between sheets $T_{fs}$, given by:

$$
T = T_{cs} + T_{fs}, \quad T_{fs} = \frac{s_{fs}}{|v_{\parallel,1}|}
$$

where $v_{\parallel,{0,1}}$ are the particle's changed parallel velocity before and after interacting with the current sheet.

In the absence of scattering, the particle would follow the field line and travel a distance:

$$
s_0 = v_{\parallel,0} \cdot T = v_{\parallel,0} \left( T_{cs} + \frac{s_{fs}}{|v_{\parallel,1}|} \right).
$$

However, when scattering occurs, the total distance traveled becomes:

$$
s = s_{cs}^* + \text{sign}\left(\frac{v_{\parallel,1}}{v_{\parallel,0}}\right) s_{fs}
$$

where $s_{cs}^*$ is the effective parallel distance the particle travels within the current sheet. The net displacement compared to the unperturbed case is then:

$$
\Delta s_\parallel = s - s_0 = (s_{cs}^* - v_{\parallel,0} T_{cs}) + s_{fs} \left(1 - \frac{v_{\parallel,0}}{v_{\parallel,1}} \right).
$$

Under the approximation that $s_{cs}^* << s_{fs}$, we obtain:

$$
\Delta s_\parallel \approx s_{fs} \left(1 - \frac{v_{\parallel,0}}{v_{\parallel,1}} - \frac{v_{\parallel,0} T_{cs}}{s_{fs}} \right).
$$

The parallel spatial diffusion coefficient is then expressed as:

$$
\kappa_\parallel = \frac{(\Delta s_\parallel)^2}{\Delta t} = \frac{\left[s_{fs} \left(1 - \frac{v_{\parallel,0}}{v_{\parallel,1}} - \frac{v_{\parallel,0} T_{cs}}{s_{fs}} \right) \right]^2}{T_{cs} + \frac{s_{fs}}{v_{\parallel,1}}}.
$$

Similarly, for the perpendicular direction:

$$
\kappa_\perp = \frac{(\Delta s_\perp)^2}{T_{cs} + \frac{s_{fs}}{v_{\parallel,1}}}.
$$

The key parameters‚Äî$v_{\parallel,1}$, $T_{cs}$, $\Delta s_\perp$, and $\Delta t$‚Äîare directly extracted from test-particle simulations, while quantities such as the current sheet separation distance $s_{fs}$, thickness, shear angle, and normal orientation are treated as system parameters derived from solar wind observations. Together, these inputs enable a systematic and physically grounded estimation of spatial diffusion coefficients under realistic heliospheric conditions.

![Example trajectory of a particle interacting with a current sheet](figures/dR_perp.png)

**Data-Integrated Analytical Modeling:** To ensure consistency with heliospheric observations, these results will be calibrated using multi-spacecraft datasets spanning radial distances from 0.1 to 5 AU. The derived diffusion coefficients will then be incorporated into turbulence-based transport models, providing a current-sheet-informed extension to global energetic particle transport frameworks.

  - Refine the pitch-angle scattering model to incorporate both parallel and perpendicular spatial diffusion effects.
	
  - Conduct detailed test-particle simulations using solar wind parameters derived from multi-spacecraft observations (PSP, Wind, Juno, etc.).

### Relevance and Broader Implications

This thesis substantially advances our understanding of particle transport mechanisms within turbulent space plasmas, offering significant enhancements to SEP prediction models.

Research Context & Motivation:
My dissertation will focus on studying solar wind current sheets and their effect on the transport of energetic particles (more specifically, Solar Energetic Particles, or SEPs). Particle transport is significantly influenced by electromagnetic turbulence, where properties such as fluctuation amplitude, spectral index, and wave vector anisotropy play crucial roles in determining particle scattering rates. Traditional theories of particle scattering have largely relied on models of random magnetic field fluctuations. However, recent studies suggest that turbulence is not merely a superposition of random fluctuations but also involves coherent structures‚Äîspecifically, current sheets‚Äîthat can efficiently scatter energetic particles. These structures, formed during turbulent cascades, may dominate scattering efficiency compared to classical quasilinear models. My research aims to bridge this gap by quantifying how current sheets govern particle scattering and spatial diffusion, ultimately improving models of solar energetic particle (SEP) transport.

Progress to Date:
1. So far, I have analyzed the properties of current sheets using data from multiple satellites including Juno, Artemis, Wind, and PSP. This work has enabled me to study the evolution of current sheet properties that are important for particle scattering across the inner heliosphere (from approximately 0.1 AU near the Sun to about 5 AU near Jupiter). Additionally, I developed a theoretical multifluid model that effectively explains the observed Alfv√©nicity in these regions.

2. Leveraging detailed statistical analyses, I have incorporated realistic solar wind parameters into pitch-angle scattering models, which enabled me to quantify the scattering rates produced by current sheets at 1 AU

Proposed Research Direction:
Building on this foundation, my next objective is to develop an observation-based model of SEP transport that can be integrated into global SEP transport frameworks. I plan to extend the current pitch-angle scattering model to account for both parallel and perpendicular spatial diffusion of energetic particles. By incorporating solar wind measurements at various radial distances, I aim to formalize the scattering efficiency and spatial diffusion coefficients attributed to solar wind current sheets. This enhanced model will provide a more comprehensive understanding of how coherent structures influence SEP transport from their origin near the Sun to further out in the heliosphere.

Methodology & Timeline:
‚Ä¢ Methodology: I will refine the existing pitch-angle scattering model by incorporating spatial diffusion processes and integrating multi-satellite observational data to calibrate and validate the extended model.
‚Ä¢ Timeline: I plan to complete the model refinement over the next several months, followed by a phase of validation and integration into broader global SEP transport models.

\title{Quantification of ion scattering by solar wind current sheets: pitch-angle diffusion rates}

\begin{abstract}
The transport of energetic particles in the heliosphere is profoundly influenced by interactions with coherent structures in the turbulent magnetic field of the solar wind, particularly current sheets. While prior studies have largely relied on idealized turbulence models, this work quantifies the role of solar wind current sheets (quasi-1D plasma structures characterized by strong magnetic field gradients) in driving pitch-angle scattering. We present an analytical Hamiltonian framework coupled with test particle simulations, informed by observational data from the ARTEMIS and Wind missions, to model particle dynamics through current sheets with realistic parameters. Our results demonstrate that the scattering efficiency depends critically on the current sheet's shear angle, relative magnitude of the magnetic field component directed along the normal to the current sheet surface, and the ratio of the particle gyroradius to the current sheet thickness. Large pitch-angle jumps, arising from non-adiabatic separatrix crossings in phase space, lead to rapid chaotization, whereas diffusive scattering broadens the pitch-angle distributions. Statistical analysis of solar wind current sheets at 1 AU reveals significant scattering rates for 100 keV-1 MeV protons, with implications for particle transport and shock acceleration mechanisms. The derived diffusion rates enable the inclusion of coherent structures into global transport models for a more accurate modeling of energetic particle dynamics in the heliosphere. These findings underscore the importance of current sheets in shaping energetic particle spatial distributions and provide practical methods for incorporating them in space and astrophysical plasmas.

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec-conclusion}

In this study, we have investigated the scattering of energetic particles by current sheets in the solar wind and developed a model that incorporates the rotational effects $Œ≤$, the magnetic field magnitude $B_0$, and the current sheet thickness $L$. Our findings indicate that current sheets characterized by large rotation angles or relatively small characteristic velocities, defined as $\tilde{v}_B = \frac{q B_0 L}{m c^2}$, can effectively scatter energetic particles. These scattering effects go beyond the conventional diffusion framework, as large pitch-angle jumps lead to rapid particle mixing in pitch-angles. Leveraging extensive observations of solar wind current sheets at 1 AU, we have provided a statistical estimate that quantifies the long-term scattering rate of energetic particles due to current sheets.

In the heliosphere, beyond 1AU, the background magnetic field strength decreases approximately as $\sim 1/r$ with increasing radial distance, where the azimuthal component $B_{\phi}$ dominates and $B \approx B_{\phi}\sim 1/r$. The magnitude of the current sheet magnetic field ($B_0$) scales accordingly  with the background field \cite{zhangSolarWindDiscontinuities2025}. Based on recent observations, the current sheet thickness, $L$, scales with the ion inertial length, $d_i \propto 1/\sqrt{N}$, which increases with radial distance due to the decline in plasma density, $N\propto 1/r^2$ \cite{marucaTransHeliosphericSurveyRadial2023}. Consequently, the characteristic velocity $\tilde{v}_B \propto B_0 L$ remains nearly constant with the radial distance, implying that energetic particles consistently undergo significant scattering by current sheets as they propagate through the heliosphere. The higher occurrence rate of current sheets closer to the Sun \cite{liuCharacteristicsInterplanetaryDiscontinuities2021, lotekarKineticscaleCurrentSheets2022} implies an even more pronounced impact on the transport of solar energetic particles.

These findings may have significant implications for the dynamics of energetic particles in both space and astrophysical plasmas. Efficient pitch-angle scattering enhances the ability of particles to reverse direction along magnetic field lines, thereby reducing their tendency to stream freely and limiting parallel transport. In quasilinear theory, the parallel spatial diffusion coefficient is approximately inversely proportional to the pitch-angle diffusion coefficient for resonant interactions \cite{engelbrechtTheoryCosmicRay2022, jokipiiCosmicRayPropagationCharged1966, jokipiiAddendumErratumCosmicRay1968}. As a result, stronger pitch-angle scattering leads to shorter acceleration timescales in diffusive shock acceleration mechanisms \cite{katouTheoryStochasticShock2019, malkovNonlinearTheoryDiffusive2001}. Additionally, observations frequently reveal broad spatial distributions of solar energetic particles and the formation of particle reservoirs \citep{cohenSolarEnergeticParticles2021}, suggesting either reduced diffusion rates along magnetic field lines or highly efficient cross-field diffusion \citep{zhangPropagationSolarEnergetic2009}. Our results indicate that the pitch-angle scattering due to current sheets can significantly affect parallel and perpendicular transport, and this point will be addressed in future work.

\title{Solar wind discontinuities in the outer heliosphere: spatial distribution between 1 and 5 AU}

\begin{keypoints}
\item We provide statistics of solar wind discontinuities observed between 1 and 5 AU
\item Current density and thickness of discontinuities evolve with the radial distance as Alfv√©n current density and proton inertial length
\item The occurrence rate of discontinuities decreases with radial distance from the Sun, following a $1/r$ relationship
\end{keypoints}

\begin{abstract}
Solar wind discontinuities (SWDs) are kinetic plasma structures that significantly contribute to the spectrum of magnetic field fluctuations and solar wind heating. Using Juno spacecraft data from 1 AU to 5 AU, combined with measurements from Wind, ARTEMIS, and STEREO at 1 AU, we disentangle spatial (radial) and temporal (solar activity) variations of SWD properties. We find that (1) the occurrence rate of SWDs decreases with radial distance from the Sun, following a $1/r$ relationship; (2) the SWD thickness increases with radial distance, but when normalized to the ion inertial length, the thickness remains almost unchanged within $[1,5]$AU; (3) the SWD current density decreases with radial distance, but when normalized to the Alfv√©n current ($J_A = e N V_A$, where symbols have their usual definitions), the current density remains almost unchanged within $[1,5]$AU; (4) the probability distributions of SWD normalized thickness and current density remain constant over time (in the five year period of Juno cruise phase) at $1$ AU. We discuss these results in the context of theories of the origin and dynamics of SWDs.

%Solar wind discontinuities (SWDs), also known as current sheets, are kinetic plasma structures that significantly contribute to the spectrum of magnetic field fluctuations and solar wind heating. The properties of SWDs change considerably with the radial distance away from the Sun, and investigating their radial variance is crucial to understanding their origin and their role in solar wind plasma processes. In this study, we utilize a unique dataset from the Juno spacecraft's observations of SWDs during its cruise phase, when Juno traveled from Earth  ($\sim 1$AU) to Jupiter ($\sim 5$AU). We combine Juno measurements with Wind, ARTEMIS, and STEREO measurements of SWDs around $\sim 1$AU, and this combination allows us to separate temporal (with solar activity) and spatial (with radial distance) variations of SWD properties. We find that (1) the normalized to $1$AU occurrence rate of SWDs decreases with radial distance from the Sun, following a $1/r$ relationship; (2) the SWD thickness increases with radial distance, but when normalized to the ion inertial length, the thickness remains almost unchanged within $[1,5]$AU; (3) the SWD current density decreases with radial distance, but when normalized to the Alfv√©n current, the current density remains almost unchanged within $[1,5]$AU; (4) the distribution of SWD normalized thickness and current density remain constant over time (five-year period of Juno cruise phase) at $1$ AU. We discuss these results in the context of theories on the origin and dynamics of SWDs.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Solar wind discontinuities (SWDs), commonly defined as localized transient rotations or abrupt changes in the magnetic field \cite{colburnDiscontinuitiesSolarWind1966}, are micro-scale plasma structures of ion kinetic scales. They are observed throughout the heliosphere, from the inner heliosphere \cite{liuCategorizingMHDDiscontinuities2022, lotekarKineticscaleCurrentSheets2022} to the heliosheath \cite{burlagaCurrentSheetsHeliosheath2011}. Despite being discovered over half a century ago, their specific origins and the circumstances of their formation remain subjects of ongoing debate \cite<see discussion in>[and references therein]{vaskoKineticscaleCurrentSheets2022,vaskoKineticScaleCurrentSheets2024}.
Historically, SWDs were thought to originate inside 1 AU, probably near or at the Sun, and are then passively convected outward by the solar wind \cite{tsurutaniInterplanetaryDiscontinuitiesTemporal1979, sodingRadialLatitudinalDependencies2001, borovskyFluxTubeTexture2008}. However, the good agreement observed in the waiting-time analysis between solar wind data and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence simulations \cite{grecoStatisticalAnalysisDiscontinuities2009} indicates that a significant portion of these current sheet-like structures constitute the sharp boundaries between the magnetic flux tubes, intermittent structures arising spontaneously and forming rapidly and locally within MHD turbulence.
The annihilation mechanisms for these discontinuities are also uncertain. They may be unstable and some could rapidly wane or decay \cite{neugebauerTangentialDiscontinuitiesSolar1986}. Magnetic reconnection may be a a natural process that destroys them \cite<e.g.,>{Gosling12,Wilson16:cs,Phan20}. 
Further complicating this picture is the presence of different types of discontinuities in interplanetary space - specifically tangential and rotational discontinuities \cite<see discussion in>{Neugebauer06,artemyevKineticPropertiesSolar2019,wangSolarWindCurrent2024}, which are classically regarded as static solutions to the MHD equations \cite{hudsonDiscontinuitiesAnisotropicPlasma1970}. These distinct types may arise from different sources and may undergo unique evolutionary paths. Investigating discontinuities across large radial distances has the potential to address these fundamental questions about their origin and evolution.

Discontinuities have long been recognized as key signatures of intermittency in solar wind turbulence, where they contribute to the non-Gaussian character of magnetic field fluctuations \cite{borovskyContributionStrongDiscontinuities2010, grecoPartialVarianceIncrements2017}. Often localized at kinetic scales, these discontinuities are central to understanding solar wind heating and how energy cascades from larger MHD scales down to ion and electron scales \cite{osmanIntermittencyLocalHeating2012, tesseinAssociationSuprathermalParticles2013}. In particular, \citeA{tesseinAssociationSuprathermalParticles2013} used ACE data to show that intense magnetic discontinuities are more strongly correlated with suprathermal particles than interplanetary shocks, indicating that multiple mechanisms, including localized coherent structures, can accelerate these suprathermals. Likewise, \citeA{osmanIntermittencyLocalHeating2012} found that although coherent structures constitute only 19\% of the data, they contribute around 50\% of the total plasma internal energy, underscoring the importance of intermittent heating in current sheets. Numerical simulations further reinforce these observations: \citeA{dmitrukTestParticleEnergization2004} demonstrated that electrons tend to be energized along discontinuities by parallel electric fields, whereas protons gain perpendicular energy from large-scale velocity shears, offering a multiscale picture of how discontinuities drive local heating. Observations also suggest that magnetic reconnection in discontinuities (effectively 1D current sheets) is associated with localized plasma heating \cite{Gosling12}. From a theoretical standpoint, numerous studies and MHD simulations have linked the formation and destruction of discontinuities to the nonlinear dynamics of Alfv√©n waves and Alfv√©nic turbulence \cite{lerchePropagationMagneticDisturbances1975, medvedevDissipativeDynamicsCollisionless1997, grecoIntermittentMHDStructures2008, yangFormationRotationalDiscontinuities2015}, producing strong departures from the otherwise adiabatic evolution of solar wind flow \cite{matteiniIonKineticsSolar2012, tsurutaniReviewAlfvenicTurbulence2018}. Indeed, spacecraft observations reveal that the solar wind's magnetic field follows the Parker model only on average \cite{svirzhevskyHeliosphericMagneticField2021}, whereas localized current sheets, often far more intense than Parker theory predicts, are ubiquitous \cite{colburnDiscontinuitiesSolarWind1966, burlagaMicroscaleStructuresInterplanetary1968, turnerOrientationsRotationalTangential1971}. Consequently, understanding how the thickness, current density, and other properties of SWDs evolve with radial distance from the Sun is crucial for revealing their role in solar wind thermodynamics and turbulence. Addressing whether these discontinuities maintain their kinetic-scale character (e.g., remain a few ion inertial lengths wide) and whether their current density weakens in tandem with the radial drop in magnetic field can help constrain theories of their local generation, annihilation, and their overall impact on energy dissipation throughout the heliosphere.

Investigation of the evolution of SWD properties with radial distance (or alternatively, investigation of properties of SWD generation at different radial distances) has mostly been limited to comparison of SWD statistics obtained from different missions during varying phases of solar activity \cite<e.g.,>[]{marianiVariationsOccurrenceRate1973, tsurutaniInterplanetaryDiscontinuitiesTemporal1979, sodingRadialLatitudinalDependencies2001}. However, the data used in these studies were rarely compared with measurements at fixed radial distances, and the methods employed to identify discontinuities were not necessarily optimized for studying discontinuities with weak magnetic fields and long durations, such as those encountered at large radial distances. Furthermore, some measurements at different radial distances were significantly separated in time, with limited time ranges covered \cite{sodingRadialLatitudinalDependencies2001}. Consequently, there are still some ambiguities in interpreting the results of these studies. For example, it is unclear how much of the observed variation in SWD properties is caused by radial distance itself versus changing solar wind conditions. 
This study presents a statistical analysis of discontinuities observed from Earth's orbit ($\sim 1$ AU) to Jupiter's orbit ($\sim 5$ AU). We utilize data collected by the Juno spacecraft \cite{boltonJunoMission2017} during its cruise phases (2011-2016), with its orbits shown in Panel (a) of Figure~\ref{fig-overview}. Our primary goal is to investigate the radial dependence of the SWD occurrence rate and properties to gain insights into their evolution and origin. Continuous measurements of SWDs at 1 AU from missions such as Wind \cite{acunaGlobalGeospaceScience1995}, ARTEMIS \cite{angelopoulosARTEMISMission2011}, and STEREO \cite{kaiserSTEREOMissionIntroduction2008} have been utilized to distinguish temporal effects from spatial variations by examining the characteristics of discontinuities at two radial distances ($1$ AU and at Juno location) simultaneously. This distinction is crucial because temporal variations could easily be misinterpreted as spatial variations \cite<see discussion in>[]{tsurutaniInterplanetaryDiscontinuitiesTemporal1979}. Due to the potential misidentification of the SWD normal direction with single spacecraft \cite<see discussion in>[]{hausmanDeterminingNatureOrientation2004, liuFailuresMinimumVariance2023, wangSolarWindCurrent2024}, we do not differentiate between shocks and different types of discontinuities, whether they are tangential, rotational, or either \cite{neugebauerReexaminationRotationalTangential1984}.

\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

We have collected 5 years of solar wind discontinuity data from Juno, Wind, THEMIS-B, and STEREO-A. The results of our analysis can be summarized as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  The occurrence rate (normalized to that at 1 AU) of SWDs decreases with radial distance from the Sun, following a $1/r$ law within $[1,5]$ AU.
\item
  The thickness of SWDs increases with radial distance from the Sun; however, after normalization to ion inertial length, the thickness slightly decreases or remains almost constant within the 1-sigma spread of the distribution. The thickness distribution remains almost constant over a one-year observation period.
\item
  The current density of SWDs decreases with radial distance from the Sun, but after normalization to the Alfv√©n current, it slightly increases or remains almost constant well within the 1-sigma spread of the distribution. The current density distribution slightly increases from 2011 to 2016, but after normalization, it remains identical across the five years, indicating that there is no effect of long-term (i.e., solar cycle) temporal variations on the normalized current density.
\end{enumerate}

These findings provide key observational constraints for future models of SWD gener-
ation, evolution, and dissipation. Our study advances previous research by systematically
characterizing SWD properties across multiple radial distances using single spacecraft (Juno)
with the continuous verification with multi-spacecraft data at 1AU. By revealing consistent
normalization behaviors (such as thickness and current density relative to ion inertial length
and Alfv√©n current, respectively), we clarify the evolutionary trends of SWDs in the helio-
sphere. We conclude that the majority of SWDs likely originate close to the Sun and subse-
quently evolve dynamically as they propagate outward, with their persistence and structure
strongly influenced by both geometric spreading and physical dissipation processes. These
insights significantly enhance our understanding of SWD origins and their influence on solar
wind dynamics, offering a robust framework for future theoretical and observational studies.
