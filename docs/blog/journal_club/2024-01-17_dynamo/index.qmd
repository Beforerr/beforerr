## Outline

- Introduction to MHD dynamo theory
- Paper

## What is dynamo theory about?

- The **origin**, **amplification**, **saturation** and **sustainment**, of magnetic ﬁelds in the universe 

    - on the Earth, other planets and their satellites (“planetary magnetism”)
    - in the Sun and other stars (“stellar magnetism”)
    - in galaxies, clusters and the early universe (“cosmic magnetism”)

If you care about magnetic fields, you might care about dynamo theory.

## Takeaway phenomenological points {.smaller}

- Many astrophysical objects have global, ordered ﬁelds 
    - **Differential rotation**, global **symmetries** and **geometry** are important
    - Coherent structures and MHD instabilities may also be very important
    - Motivation for the development of “***large-scale***” dynamo theories 
- Lots of “small-scale”, random ﬁelds also discovered from the 70s
    - These come hand in hand with global magnetism
    - Simultaneous development of “small-scale dynamo” theory
- Astrophysical magnetism is in a nonlinear, saturated state 
    - Linear theory not the whole story (or using it requires non-trivial justiﬁcation)
    - Multiple scale interactions expected to be important

## MHD equations

MHD induction equation

$$\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}=\nabla \times(\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{B}-\eta \nabla \times \mathbf{B})$$

Incompressible, resistive, viscous MHD

$$\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t}+\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u}=-\nabla P+\mathbf{B} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{B}+\nu \Delta \mathbf{u}+\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}, t)$$

#### Lenz's Law

Electromagnetic induction suppresses rather enhances the seed magnetic ﬁeld.

## Anti-dynamo theorem {.smaller}

Observations around solar activity minimum suggest that,the large-scale solar magnetic ﬁeld is axisymmetric about the rotation axis.

$$
\mathbf{B}(r, \theta, t)=\nabla \times\left(A(r, \theta, t) \hat{\mathbf{e}}_\phi\right)+B(r, \theta, t) \hat{\mathbf{e}}_\phi .
$$

$$
\mathbf{u}(r, \theta)=\mathbf{u}_{\mathrm{p}}(r, \theta)+\varpi \Omega(r, \theta) \hat{\mathbf{e}}_\phi,
$$

MHD induction equation

$$\begin{gathered}\frac{\partial A}{\partial t}=\underbrace{\eta\left(\nabla^2-\frac{1}{\varpi^2}\right) A}_{\text {resistive decay }}-\underbrace{\frac{\mathbf{u}_{\mathrm{p}}}{\varpi} \cdot \nabla(\varpi A)}_{\text {transport }}, \\ \frac{\partial B}{\partial t}=\underbrace{\eta\left(\nabla^2-\frac{1}{\varpi^2}\right) B+\frac{1}{\varpi} \frac{\partial(\varpi B)}{\partial r} \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial r}}_{\text {resistive decay }}-\underbrace{\varpi \mathbf{u}_{\mathrm{p}} \cdot \nabla\left(\frac{B}{\varpi}\right)}_{\text {transport }} \\ -\underbrace{B \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u}_{\mathrm{p}}}_{\text {compression }}+\underbrace{\varpi\left(\nabla \times\left(A \hat{\mathbf{e}}_\phi\right)\right) \cdot \nabla \Omega}_{\text {shearing }} .\end{gathered}$$

## Anti-dynamo theorem {.smaller}

#### Cowling’s theorem

An axisymmetric ﬂow cannot sustain an axisymmetric magnetic ﬁeld against resistive decay.

#### Zel’dovich’s theorem

Planar, two-dimensional motions cannot excite a dynamo.

#### Others

- A purely toroidal ﬂow cannot excite a dynamo
- A magnetic ﬁeld of the form $B(x, y, t)$ alone cannot be a dynamo ﬁeld.

*A minimal geometric complexity is required for dynamos to work.*

## From toroidal to poloidal

We have no choice but to look for some fundamentally non-axisymmetric process to provide an additional source term in MHD induction equation.

- Turbulence and mean-field electrodynamics
- The Babcock–Leighton mechanism
- Hydrodynamical and magnetohydrodynamical instabilities (from the rotational shear layer, *tachocline*)

## Tension: Why Is Mean-Field Electrodynamics Working? {.smaller}

Separating the ﬂow and magnetic ﬁeld into large-scale, slowly varying “mean” component $〈U〉, 〈B〉$ and small-scale rapidly varying “turbulent” components $\boldsymbol{u}, \boldsymbol{b}$

$$
\begin{gathered}
\boldsymbol{U}=\langle\mathbf{U}\rangle + \boldsymbol{u}, \\
\boldsymbol{B}=\langle\mathbf{B}\rangle + \boldsymbol{b} .
\end{gathered}
$$

Occasionally interpreted as a decomposition into axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric field components in systems with a rotation axis.

$$
\frac{\partial\langle\mathbf{B}\rangle}{\partial t}=\nabla \times(\langle\mathbf{U}\rangle \times\langle\mathbf{B}\rangle+\xi-\eta \nabla \times\langle\mathbf{B}\rangle)
$$
where the mean electromotive force $\xi$ is given by the average of the small-scale flow-field cross-correlation:
$$
\xi=\left\langle\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{b}\right\rangle
$$

## Mean-Field Electrodynamics

Closure is achieved by expanding this turbulent electromotive force (emf) $\boldsymbol{\xi}$ in terms of $\langle\mathbf{B}\rangle$ and its derivatives:

$$
\xi_i=a_{i j}\left\langle B_j\right\rangle+b_{i j k} \frac{\partial\left\langle B_j\right\rangle}{\partial x_k}+\cdots
$$

This is not a ***linearization*** procedure, in that we are **not** assuming that:

$$\left|\boldsymbol{u}\right| /|\langle\boldsymbol{U}\rangle| \ll 1$$ 

$$\left|\boldsymbol{b}\right| /|\langle\boldsymbol{B}\rangle| \ll 1$$

## Tension: Why Is Mean-Field Electrodynamics Working?  {.smaller}

The challenge is now to compute these tensorial quantities from known statistical properties of the turbulent ﬂow

#### Tractable physical regimes:

1. The energy density of the mean magnetic ﬁeld is larger than the energy density of the small-scale ﬁeld;
2. The magnetic Reynolds number is low;
3. The turbulent cyclonic eddies have a lifetime shorter than their characteristic turnover time.

#### Babcock–Leighton mechanism

![](https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs41116-020-00025-6/MediaObjects/41116_2020_25_Fig3_HTML.png)

The net effect of BMRs is taking a formerly toroidal internal magnetic ﬁeld and converting a fraction of its associated ﬂux into a net surface dipole moment.

::: {.notes}
The larger sunspot pairs (‘‘bipolar magnetic regions’’, hereafter BMR) often emerge with a systematic tilt with respect to the E–W direction, in that on average, the leading sunspot (with respect to the direction of solar rotation) is located at a lower latitude than the trailing sunspot, the more so the higher the latitude of the emerging BMR (see, e.g., Stenﬂo and Kosovichev 2012; McClintock and Norton 2013). This pattern is known as ‘‘Joy’s law’’. The tilt of the magnetic axis of a BMR implies a non-zero projection along the N–S direction, which amounts to a dipole moment. The decay of BMRs and subsequent dispersal of their magnetic ﬂux by surface ﬂows can release a fraction of this dipole moment and contribute to the global dipole.

#### Hydrodynamical and magnetohydrodynamical instabilities

![tachocline](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/Tachocline.svg)

::: {.notes}
The tachocline is the rotational shear layer uncovered by helioseismology immediately beneath the Sun’s convective envelope, providing a smooth match between the latitudinal differential rotation of the envelope, and the rigidly rotating radiative core (see, e.g., Spiegel and Zahn 1992; Brown et al. 1989; Tomczyk et al. 1995; Gough and McIntyre 1998; Charbonneau et al. 1999, and references therein).

## Tension(s): From Solar to Stellar Dynamos {.smaller}

1. Which is the primary polarity reversal mechanism: α-effect, or Babcock–Leighton, . . . or something else? 
2. How do differential rotation and meridional circulation vary with rotation rate, luminosity, and internal structure? 
3. How do turbulent coefﬁcients (α-effect, turbulent pumping, turbulent diffusion) vary with rotation rate, luminosity, and internal structure? 
4. How do sunspots and BMRs form and decay in stars of varying structure (in particularly, depth of convective envelope), rotation rate and luminosity?

Unifying dynamo framework applicable to both the sun and solar type stars of varying spectral type, luminosity, and rotation rate.
