"Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun." - Douglas Adams

On the importance of being Magnetic

"... a sunspot is a vortex, in which electrified"

Plasma is different

- Collision, faster particle collide less and can be accelerated more easily
    - Inverse Robin Hood D.T. Runaway is possible

Warped heliospheric current sheet is limited in space and time (1Au and further)

You can treat everything as a fluid as long as you find a way to close the system with proper equations of state
