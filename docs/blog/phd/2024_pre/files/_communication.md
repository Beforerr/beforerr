====== SDW ======
looks much better than EMIC... i do not have specific comments here, just again slightly specify what you would like to do and what are expected results, so this will looking like a project for a couple student papers... not like this is investigation programm of the research lab

====== EMIC proposal ======
Abstract: you should not make it too general, like if this is a project for dozen publications. Make it more realistic: we would like to use the advantage of ELFIN measurements of EMIC-driven precipitations during storm time events to understand EMIC contribution into formation of energetic electron spectra, that are usually modeled using whistler-mode waves and plasma injection only.

Background and Motivation: you may exclude the paragraph about space weather, because it looks too artificial. I think you may start with effects of spectrum formation (from Effects of Wave-particle Resonant Interactions) and then explain that EMIC contribution has not be account yet in this process, so you plan to check how EMIC affect the spectrum of energetic electrons. Try to avoid such things as “gaps in our understanding of what roles these waves,” … here you should speak about specific waves (EMIC, I assume)

Expected Contributions: be more specific here… instead of “This research project aims to advance our understanding of how EMIC or/and whistler waves influence radiation belt electrons” say something about providing estimates of EMIC wave contribution to electron spectrum shape formed by injections and whistler-mode waves. Question line “How exactly do these waves together influence electron pitch angles and energies, and under what specific conditions do these interactions lead to net electron losses or gains?” can be a topic of the 5 years proposal for the entire team of researchers.
