## A whistler mode chorus event

> Obtain and analyze DC and AC wave data for an event, including wave polarization and Poynting flux. A whistler mode chorus event observed by THEMIS, occurred on TH-E (P5) at ~10:00-10:15 UT on 2008-12-15 (referenced in the class notes in Lecture 10, p.5) taken from the paper by Li et al., JGR 2011.

> In the overview plots (here and here), E & B wavepower is significant during significant velocity oscillations. A different whistler mode chorus event was observed by MMS on 2019-08-16 at ~09:32:00UT within a flux pileup region shown in Fig. 2 of Fu et al., GRL 2025. MMS overview plot is here. Follow the structure of Hwk05_01.pro (just an example). Work in either IDL or PySPEDAS, for either the THEMIS or the MMS event to:

> - Fig. 1. Identify the event in overview plots and point out the wave power related to it
> - Fig. 2. Get the Electric Field (Double-Probe) Instruments (EFI) data, remove offsets, show ExB velocity, using E*B=0 approximation
> - Fig. 3. Plot on-board computed spectra. Overplot fce, 1⁄2 fce
> - Fig. 4. Recognize (wave)burst times in the waveforms and plot them and the spectra
> - Fig. 5. Introduce E and B and show ground computed spectra (wavelet and Fourier)
> - Fig. 6. Rotate into FAC coord’s and feed waveforms into wave analysis program. Plot results. Read the section of the relevant paper and explain the role/significance of the whistler waves in their respective setting.
> - Fig. 7. Show the Poynting flux for the band-passed signal. Do this is time domain (process time series in real space) and in frequency domain (using the available tools).
