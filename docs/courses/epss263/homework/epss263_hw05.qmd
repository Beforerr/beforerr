## Alfven current

> Compute the parallel current from a *bipolar* Alfvén wavepacket. In the simulation lecture it was shown that a *unipolar* pulse (magnetic bomb, Bz unipolar gaussian) creates a field aligned current. The direction of that current was computed from curlB (left panel in the 2D result) and (in simulation coordinates) from $J_x=[±1/(μ_0 C_a)] dE_y/dy$ (right panel in the 2D result).

### Unipolar Alfvén wavepacket

Multiply the RHS image by the sign corresponding to the propagation direction, we get the LHS image.

### Bipolar Alfvén wavepacket

To create a bipolar pulse in dBz and let it evolve on both sides. The init input is as follows:

```fortran
case(6)
    !2D gaussian perturbation in Bz modulated by a odd function of x
    do iz = izmin,izmax
        do iy = iymin,iymax
            do ix = ixmin,ixmax
                uu(ix,iy,iz,7) = uu(ix,iy,iz,7) + db0 * (xgrid(ix) - 0.5*Lx) * &
                exp( -( (xgrid(ix)-0.5*Lx)/(0.01*Lx) )**2 - ((ygrid(iy)-0.5*Ly)/(0.01*Ly))**2)
            enddo
        enddo
    enddo
```

The basic idea is to change the amplitude modulation part from a constant to a odd function like `(xgrid(ix) - 0.5*Lx)` (sin would also work).

The figures below show the current density in the x direction for the bipolar Alfvén wavepacket.

## Hydrodynamic shock

> Show that the entropy across a hydrodynamic shock increases: (i) First, prove equation III.80 in Siscoe (you can use the jumps in p and $ρ$ previously derived). (ii) Next, take the derivative of the entropy ratio as function of Mach number and show it is positive. Thus explain that starting from M1=1 and moving upwards all M1 values have positive entropy ratios. (iii) Plot the entropy ratio as function of M1 for a range of adiabatic indices. (iv) Under what conditions does the entropy not increase? [Ans. $γ=1$] When might such conditions occur in space plasmas and why? [Ans. parallel shocks]

Given the jump conditions of pressure and density:

$$
\rho _2\to \frac{(γ +1)}{γ +\frac{2}{M_1^2}-1} \rho _1
$$
$$
p_2\to \frac{\left(2 γ  M_1^2-(γ -1)\right)}{γ +1} p_1 
$$

And as the entropy is defined as $\alpha_i\text{:=} p_i / \rho _i^{γ}$

```mathematica
assums = { Subscript[ρ, 1] > 0, γ > 0, Subscript[M, 1] > 0};
ratio = Simplify[α[2]/α[1] /. rules, assums]
```

gives us

$$
α[2]/α[1] = (γ +1)^{-γ -1} \left(γ +\frac{2}{M_1^2}-1\right)^{γ } \left(-γ +2 γ  M_1^2+1\right) = \left(\frac{1}{γ+1}\right)^{γ+1}\left[2 γ M_1^2-(γ-1)\right]\left(γ-1+\frac{2}{M_1^2}\right)^γ
$$

Taking the derivative of the entropy ratio with respect to $M_1$:

```mathematica
dRatio = D[ratio, M1];
dRatio = Simplify[dRatio, assums];
dRatio /. formatRules
```

gives us

$$
\frac{d}{d M_1} \left(\frac{α_2}{α_1}\right) = 
4 (γ -1) γ  (γ +1)^{-γ -1} \left(M_1^2-1\right)^2 M_1^{-2 γ -1} \left((γ -1) M_1^2+2\right)^{γ -1}
$$

The derivative is positive for all $M_1>0$ values as long as $γ>1$. And when $M_1=1$, the ratio is equal to 1.

The plot of the entropy ratio as a function of $M_1$ for a range of adiabatic indices is shown below.

```mathematica
γs = {1, 4/3, 5/3, 2};
LogLogPlot[
 Evaluate[ratio /. γ -> γs], {M1, 1, 100}, 
 PlotLegends -> γs
 ]
```

![](figures/entropy_ratio.svg)

And we can see that when $γ=1$, the entropy ratio is constant and equal to 1. As $p = α_1 ρ^γ = n k T$, this corresponds to the case where the temperature is constant across the shock. Isothermal behavior is due to fast, field-aligned escaping electrons and this is more likely to occur in parallel shocks.

The mathematica notebook for this question and the following question is available [here](./epss263_hw05.nb).

## Perpendicular Shock

> a. Show Eq. III.90 following Siscoe notes. Follow same procedure as in III.73 to factor the known solution and derive the quadratic coefficients. Write (X-1)(X^2 + A_1 X + A_0)=0 where X = (U2/U1) and solve for A0 and A1 given the coefficients of the cubic. For extra testing of cubic, make sure that X=1 is indeed a valid solution. As another test of your cubic equation (you can do that always during the derivation): Set $A_1 → ∞$ and validate it becomes a quadratic that is identical to III.71 (with M1 defined same as S1).

The continuity relations for the perpendicular shock can be written as
$$
\begin{aligned}
& [[\rho U]]=0 \\
& \left[\left[\rho U^2+p+\frac{B^2}{2 \mu_0}\right]\right]=0 \\
& {\left[\left[\left(\frac{1}{2} \rho U^2+\frac{\gamma}{\gamma-1} \rho+\frac{B^2}{\mu_0}\right) U\right]\right]=0} \\
& {[[U B]]=0}
\end{aligned}
$$

Normalizing the magnetic pressure by the ram pressure and the thermal pressure by the ram pressure

$$
B_1^2\to \frac{\rho _1 U_1^2}{A^2}
$$
$$
p_1\to \frac{\rho _1 U_1^2}{\gamma  S^2}
$$

And Elimitating $B_2$, $\rho_2$ and $p_2$ from the equations

```mathematica
massEq := \[Rho]1 U1 == \[Rho]2 U2
momEq := \[Rho]1 U1^2 + p1 + B1^2/2 == \[Rho]2 U2^2 + p2 + B2^2/2
energyEq := (1/2 \[Rho]1 U1^2 + f p1 + B1^2) U1 == (1/2 \[Rho]2 U2^2 +
      f p2 + B2^2) U2
FaradayEq := B1 U1 == B2 U2
eqs = {massEq, momEq, energyEq, FaradayEq};

Simplify[
 Eliminate[eqs, {B2, \[Rho]2, p2}] /. rules, {Subscript[U, 1] > 0, 
  Subscript[\[Rho], 1] > 0}]
```

We get the following equation

$$
\frac{(r-1) \left(A^2 r \left(S^2 (-\gamma +\gamma  r+r+1)-2\right)+S^2 (\gamma +\gamma  (-r)-2)\right)}{A (\gamma -1) S}=0
$$

where $r = U_2/U_1$.

Clearly, $r=1$ is a solution. We can collect the rest equation to get the quadratic equation in $r$

```mathematica
Collect[S^2 (-2 + \[Gamma] - r \[Gamma]) + A^2 r (-2 + S^2 (1 + r - \[Gamma] + r \[Gamma])) == 0, r]
```

we get

$$
r^2 \left(A^2 \gamma  S^2+A^2 S^2\right)+r \left(-A^2 \gamma  S^2+A^2 S^2-2 A^2-\gamma  S^2\right)+\gamma  S^2-2 S^2=0
$$

This is exactly the same as Eq. III.90 in Siscoe notes.

> b. Solve the quadratic to find the two solutions for U2. Show that one is non-physical, and identify the remaining, physical one.

```mathematica
assums = {A > 0 , S > 0, \[Gamma] > 1};
Solve[eqR, {r}, Reals, Assumptions -> assums] // Simplify
```
Solve the quadratic equation, we get

$$
\left\{\left\{r\to \frac{A^2 \left((\gamma -1) S^2+2\right)-\sqrt{A^4 \left((\gamma -1) S^2+2\right)^2+A^2 \left(\left(-2 \gamma ^2+2 \gamma +8\right) S^4+4 \gamma  S^2\right)+\gamma ^2 S^4}+\gamma  S^2}{2 A^2 (\gamma +1) S^2}\right\},\left\{r\to \frac{A^2 \left((\gamma -1) S^2+2\right)+\sqrt{A^4 \left((\gamma -1) S^2+2\right)^2+A^2 \left(\left(-2 \gamma ^2+2 \gamma +8\right) S^4+4 \gamma  S^2\right)+\gamma ^2 S^4}+\gamma  S^2}{2 A^2 (\gamma +1) S^2}\right\}\right\}
$$

The first solution is non-physical as it is negative. The physical solution is

$$
r_1\text{:=}\frac{A^2 \left((\gamma -1) S^2+2\right)+\sqrt{A^4 \left((\gamma -1) S^2+2\right)^2+A^2 \left(\left(-2 \gamma ^2+2 \gamma +8\right) S^4+4 \gamma  S^2\right)+\gamma ^2 S^4}+\gamma  S^2}{2 A^2 (\gamma +1) S^2}
$$

In the limit of $A\to\infty$

```mathematica
Subscript[r, 1] := 
 1/(2 A^2 S^2 (1 + \[Gamma])) (A^2 (2 + S^2 (-1 + \[Gamma])) + 
    S^2 \[Gamma] + \[Sqrt](A^4 (2 + S^2 (-1 + \[Gamma]))^2 + 
       S^4 \[Gamma]^2 + 
       A^2 (4 S^2 \[Gamma] + S^4 (8 + 2 \[Gamma] - 2 \[Gamma]^2))))
Simplify[Limit[Subscript[r, 1], {A -> \[Infinity]}], assums]
```

we can see that the solution becomes

$$
\frac{(\gamma -1) S^2+2}{(\gamma +1) S^2}
$$

which is the same as Eq. III.71 in Siscoe notes for hydrodynamic shocks.

> c. Plot the solution as function of A1 and M1 (color, contour or surface plot OK). Show that the limits for $A_1→∞$ and $M_1→∞$ are as expected.

In the limit of $A_1→∞$ and $M_1→∞$, the solution approaches $\frac{\gamma -1}{\gamma +1}$. For $γ=5/3$, the solution approaches 0.25, which is expected. The contour plot of the solution is shown below.

```mathematica
Block[{\[Gamma] = 5/3, p1, p2},
 p1 = ContourPlot[r1, {A, 0, 100}, {S, 0, 100}, 
   PlotLegends -> Automatic];
 p2 = ContourPlot[r1, {A, 0, 10}, {S, 0, 10}, 
   PlotLegends -> Automatic];
 Export["figures/shock_U2.svg", p1];
 Export["figures/shock_U2_zoom.svg", p2];
 {p1, p2}
 ]
```
