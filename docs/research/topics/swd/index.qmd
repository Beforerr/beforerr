# Solar wind discontinuities (SWD)

> Discontinuous changes in plasmas parameters and magnetic fields. ~~Confucius~~ Colburn et al., 1966

- Import element of solar wind turbulences @borovskyContributionStrongDiscontinuities2010.

- Very kinetic structure:

  - Jumps in the electron density, temperature and pitch angle distribution @artemyevKineticNatureSolar2019.

  - Interact with energetic part of the solar wind ions
