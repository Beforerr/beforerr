# Solar wind discontinuities (SWD)

> Discontinuous changes in plasmas parameters and magnetic fields. ~~Confucius~~ Colburn et al., 1966

- Import element of solar wind turbulences @borovskyContributionStrongDiscontinuities2010.

- Very kinetic structure:

  - Jumps in the electron density, temperature and pitch angle distribution @artemyevKineticNatureSolar2019.

  - Interact with energetic part of the solar wind ions

## Formation of SWD

Turbulent ion heating by reconnection of tangential discontinuities. (a) Current density (color) and magnetic field lines, possible reconnection sites are indicated by crosses. (b) The proton temperature anisotropy (color) that indicates acceleration

Alfven wave steepening results in the discontinuity formation: magnetic energy transport from large scale (Alfven waves generated in the solar corona) to small (ion kinetic) scales of discontinuities, where this energy can be dissipated to particle heating
