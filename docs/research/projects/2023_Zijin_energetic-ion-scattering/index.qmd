title: Energetic ion scattering by solar wind discontinuities
author: Zijin Zhang
abstract: In this studay, we consider observational-based model of ion dynamics and scattering in force-free rotational magnetic discontinuities. Focusing on quantification of the scattering effect, we demonstrate that background sheared magnetic field plays an important role in determining the efficiency of pitch angle scattering...
