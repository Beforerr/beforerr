    "For a day/time of interest (different from the notes) from THEMIS or MMS (or RBSP or other), based on your perusal of the overview plots at the mission website, and using standard tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Obtain EFI data in spinning and despun spacecraft coord’s and in some geophysical (e.g., GSE or GSM) coord’s. \n",
    "- Using the data in DSL or DMPA coordinates (where XY are despun, spin-plane components) estimate the offset in X and Y from a quiet time in the magnetosphere when the flows, and hence –VxB, are expected to be slow. Remove the offset from the data.\n",
    "- With the spin plane offsets removed, obtain the 3rd component (Z) for times when the Bfield is at a large angle relative to the spin plane (>10deg or more) using the E*B=0 approximation. \n",
    "- Compare your estimate of Ez with the measurement of the same component made by the axial electric field boom pair. How large are the offsets for the axial field compared to those you have found for the spin plane components? \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: A crib sheet and a jupyter notebook on how to perform the offset removal and EdotB determination are my_thm_efi_load_cal_crib.pyspd and my_thm_efi_load_cal_crib.py, located in the class notes below Lecture 12. Use a different spacecraft for your solution. A good day for THEMIS is another spacecraft from the first Science paper (2008-02-26 4-6UT)– except TH-D which is in the released crib sheet. A good day for MMS is the first Science [paper](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaf2939) (2015-10-16 13:05-13:08UT) from any of the four MMS spacecraft.\n"
