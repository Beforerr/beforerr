## 2. Winding number

> equals the winding number of the argument of f around the circle $|z| = ϵ$. Then use the residue theorem to show that this equals the degree of the zero, in agreement with the argument principle.

The integral

$$
\int_{C} \frac{f'(z)}{f(z)} dz = \int_{C} \frac{1}{f(z)} df(z) = \int_{f(C)} \frac{1}{w} dw
$$

effectively measures the total change in the argument of $f(z)$ as $z$ traverses the circle, which equals the winding number of the argument of $f$.

Since $f(z)$ is holomorphic in the disc $|z| \leq \epsilon$ and has a zero at $z = 0$, $f(z)$ can be locally expressed as $z^n g(z)$, where $n$ is the degree of the zero.

Then, $f'(z) = n z^{n−1} g(z) + z^n g'(z)$, and so

$$
\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)} = \frac{n}{z} + \frac{g'(z)}{g(z)}
$$

The residue at $z=0$ is the coefficient of $\frac{1}{z}$ in this expression, which is $n$, the degree of the zero.

## 4. Analytic continuation and Fourier coefficents

> Give an analytic continuation of $\cos θ$ from the unit circle $z = e^{iθ}$ to the complex plane minus the origin.
>
> Conclude that the Fourier coefficients $c_n$ of $e^{- \cos θ}$ decrease faster than any exponential, meaning $c_n = o(e^{−αn})$ for all $α$ as $n → ±∞$. Compare this to the Fourier series of $1/(cos θ −3/2)$, what is the decay of its Fourier coefficents?

### Analytic continuation

On the unit circle $z=e ^ {iθ}$, $\cos \theta = \frac{1}{2} (e^{iθ} +e^{−iθ}) = \frac{1}{2} (z+ z^{-1})$. This expression provides an analytic continuation of $\cos \theta$ to the complex plane minus the origin, as it is well-defined for all $z \neq 0$.

### Fourier coefficents of $e^{−\cos \theta}$

The function $e^{−\cos \theta}$ is smooth and periodic. The Fourier coefficients $c_n$ of a periodic function $f(θ)$ are given by:

$$
c_n= 1/2π ∫_{0}^{2π} f(θ)e^{inθ}dθ = 1/2π \int_{0}^{2π} e^{-\cos θ + i n θ}dθ
$$

$$
1/2π \int_{0}^{2π} e^{-\cos θ + i n θ} dθ = 1/2π \int_{|z|=1} e^{-z/2-1/2z} z^n \frac{dz}{i z} = Res_{z=0} { e^{-z/2-1/2z} z^{n-1} }
$$

The coefficient $a_{-n}$ of $g(z)=e^{-z/2-1/2z}$ at the point of $z=0$ can de derived by expanding by separately $e^{-z/2}$ as Talyor Series and $e^{−1/(2z)}$ as a Laurent Series and then multiplying these series together

$$
a_{-n} = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} (-\frac{1}{2})^k \frac{1}{k!} (-\frac{1}{2})^{(n+k)} \frac{1}{(n+k)!}
$$

So fourier coefficients $c_n$

$$
c_n = a_{-n}  \leq  |a_{-n} | \leq \frac{1}{2^{n}}\frac{1}{n!}
$$

decrease faster than any exponential.

### Fourier coefficents of $\frac{1}{\cos \theta - 3/2}$

The Fourier coefficients $c_n$ of a periodic function $f(θ)$ are given by:

$$
\begin{aligned}
c_n
&= \frac{1}{2π} \int_{0}^{2π} f(θ)e^{inθ}dθ \\
&= \frac{1}{2π} \int_{0}^{2π} \frac{1}{\cos \theta - 3/2}e^{i n θ}dθ \\
&= \frac{1}{2πi} \int_{|z| = 1} \frac{2z}{z^2-3z+1} z^{n-1} dz
\end{aligned}
$$

Let $z^2 - 3z+1=(z-z_1)(z-z_2)$, where $z_1 = \frac{1}{2} \left(3-\sqrt{5}\right), z_2=\frac{1}{2} \left(3 + \sqrt{5}\right)$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
c_n
&= Res_{z=z_1}  \frac{2z}{(z-z_1)(z-z_2)} z^{n-1} \\
&= \frac{2 z_1}{z_1-z_2} {z_1}^{n-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

## 5. Laurent series and singularity

Let's consider a function $f$ that is holomorphic in a disc around $z_0$ except at $z_0$ itself. 

1. **Removable Singularity:**

    If $f$ has a removable singularity at $z_0$, it means that $f$ can be extended to a holomorphic function at $z_0$. In terms of the Laurent series, this implies that all the coefficients $a_n$ for $n < 0$ are zero because it reduces to its Taylor series. 

    Conversely, if all $a_n = 0$ for $n < 0$, the Laurent series reduces to a Taylor series, implying that $f$ is holomorphic at $z_0$ (since it can be expressed as a power series), and thus the singularity is removable.
2. **Pole of Order $m$ :**

    If $f$ has a pole of order $m$ at $z_0$, it means that in the Laurent series, there is a term with $(z - z_0)^{-m}$ (where $a_{-m} \neq 0$) and no terms with higher negative powers.

    Conversely, if there is some $m < 0$ such that $a_m \neq 0$ but $a_n = 0$ for all $n < m$, then the Laurent series has a term $a_m (z - z_0)^m$ as its term with the highest negative power, indicating a pole of order $m$ .
3. **Essential Singularity:**

    If the singularity at $z_0$ is neither removable nor a pole, it must be an essential singularity. This is characterized by the fact that there are infinitely many negative powers of $z - z_0$ in the Laurent series with non-zero coefficients. In other words, if the Laurent series has non-zero $a_n$ for infinitely many $n < 0$, then $z_0$ is an essential singularity.

According to the Weierstrass factorization theorem, an entire function can be represented as a product over its zeros. The function $\sin \pi z$ is entire and has zeros at all integers. The product representation for $\sin \pi z$ is given by:

$$
\sin \pi z = \pi z \prod_{n=1}^{\infty} \left(1 - \frac{z}{n}\right)\left(1 + \frac{z}{n}\right) 
=  \sin \pi z = \pi z \prod_{n=1}^{\infty} \left(1 - \frac{z^2}{n^2}\right)
$$

The Taylor series expansion of $\sin \pi z$ around $z = 0$ is:

$$
\sin \pi z = \pi z - \frac{\pi^3 z^3}{3!} + \frac{\pi^5 z^5}{5!} - \frac{\pi^7 z^7}{7!} + \cdots
$$

Now, let's expand the infinite product to the first couple of terms and keeping terms up to $z^3$, we get:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\pi z \prod_{n=1}^{\infty} \left(1 - \frac{z^2}{n^2}\right) 
&= \pi z \left(1 - \frac{z^2}{1^2}\right)\left(1 - \frac{z^2}{2^2}\right)\left(1 - \frac{z^2}{3^2}\right) \cdots \\
&= \pi z \left(1 - z^2 \left(\frac{1}{1^2} + \frac{1}{2^2} + \frac{1}{3^2} + \cdots\right) + \cdots \right) 
\end{aligned}
$$

Comparing the coefficient of $z^3$ from the Taylor series and the product expansion, we have:

$$
-\frac{\pi^3}{6} = -\pi \left(\frac{1}{1^2} + \frac{1}{2^2} + \frac{1}{3^2} + \cdots\right)
$$

This is the result we want.
