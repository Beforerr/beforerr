The Gamma function

$$
\Gamma(z) = \int_{0}^{\infty} t^{z-1} e^{-t} dt
$$

after performing a change of variables by setting $t = zu$, which yields:

$$
\Gamma(z) = z^z \int_{0}^{\infty} u^{z-1} e^{-zu} du
$$

The method of steepest descent involves analyzing the integrand's behavior around its saddle points, where the first derivative of the exponent vanishes. For our integral, the exponent is $-zu + (z-1)\log(u)$. The saddle point occurs where its derivative with respect to $u$ is zero. This gives us:

$$
-z + \frac{z-1}{u} = 0
$$

$$
u = \frac{z-1}{z} \approx 1 \quad \text{for large } z
$$

Near the saddle point $u = 1$, we approximate the exponent by a second-order Taylor expansion:

$$
-zu + (z-1)\log(u) \approx -z + (z-1)\log(z) - \frac{z}{2}(u-1)^2
$$

The integral can now be approximated as:

$$
\Gamma(z) \approx z^z e^{-z} e^{(z-1)\log(z)} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-\frac{z}{2}(u-1)^2} du
$$

With the Gaussian integral evaluates to:

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-\frac{z}{2}(u-1)^2} du = \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{z}}
$$

We get:

$$
\Gamma(z) \sim e^{-z} z^z \left(\frac{2\pi}{z}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}
$$

### Verifying the Airy Function as a Solution

Taking the Fourier transform on both sides of equation we get

$$
\mathcal{F}\left(\frac{d^2 y}{d x^2}\right)=\mathcal{F}(x y),
$$

For the L.H.S., we get

$$
\mathcal{F}\left(\frac{d^2 y}{d x^2}\right)=\frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \frac{d^2 y}{d x^2} e^{-i k x} d x = =-k^2 \mathcal{F}(y) .
$$

For the R.H.S.  based on the derivative of the Fourier transform with respect to $k$ we get,

$$
\frac{d}{d k} \mathcal{F}(y)=\frac{d}{d k}\left(\frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} y e^{-i k x} d x\right),
$$

Therefore,

$$
\frac{d}{d k} \mathcal{F}(y)=\frac{1}{2 \pi} \int^{+\infty} \frac{d}{d k}\left(y e^{-i k x}\right) d x=\frac{1}{2 \pi} \int^{+\infty}(-i x) y e^{-i k x} d x
$$

We have

$$
\mathcal{F}(x y)=i \frac{d \mathcal{F}(y)}{d k},
$$

So the equation becomes

$$
-k^2 \mathcal{F}(y)=i \frac{d \mathcal{F}(y)}{d k},
$$

the only solution is

$$
\mathcal{F}(y)=e^{i \frac{k^3}{3}},
$$

taking the inverse Fourier transform, we get a solution satisfying the differential equation. Hence we have the final solution as

$$
y=A i(x)=\frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} e^{i\left(k x+\frac{k^3}{3}\right)} d k .
$$

### Saddle Points

The exponent in the integral is $ixy + \frac{i}{3}y^3$. To find the saddle points, we set the derivative of this expression with respect to $y$ equal to zero:

$$
ix + iy^2 = 0
$$

## $Z(\epsilon)$ function

> $$
> Z(\epsilon)=\int d x e^{-x^2-\epsilon x^4} \quad \epsilon \rightarrow 0^{+}
> $$
>
> and then use Borel summation to evaluate the integral.

The expansion is based on the Taylor series of $e^{-\epsilon x^4}$ around $\epsilon = 0$:

$$
e^{-\epsilon x^4} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-\epsilon x^4)^n}{n!}
$$

Substituting this series into the integral and integrating term by term, we get:

$$
Z(\epsilon) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-\epsilon)^n}{n!} \int dx\, x^{4n} e^{-x^2}
$$

Each term in this series can be integrated using standard methods, often involving gamma functions for even powers of $x$.

The Borel sum is then given by an integral of the Borel transform against an exponential:

$$
\tilde{Z}(\epsilon) = \int_0^\infty e^{-t} B(t \epsilon) dt
$$

where $B(t)$ is the Borel transform of the series.
