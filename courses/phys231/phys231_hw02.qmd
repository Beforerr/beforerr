The product $ab$ can be written as:

$$
ab = \left(1 + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n z^n \right) \left( \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} b_n z^n \right) = 1
$$

By expanding, we get:

$$
ab = b_0 + (b_1 + a_1 b_0) z + (b_2 + a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_0) z^2 + \dots + \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k b_{n-k} \right) z^n + \dots
$$

For $ab = 1$, all the coefficients of $z^n$ (for $n \geq 1$) must be zero, and the constant term (the coefficient of $z^0$) must be 1. This gives us the following conditions:

1. $b_0 = 1$ (since the constant term of $ab$ must be 1).
2. For $n \geq 1$, we have $\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k b_{n-k} = 0$.

For $a_k$, we have $a_0 = 1$ and $a_n$ for $n \geq 1$. Thus, the recurrence relation for $b_n$ becomes:

$$
b_n = -\sum_{k=1}^{n} a_k b_{n-k} \quad \text{for } n \geq 1
$$

For $a = e^z$. The power series for $b=  1/e^z$ is given by:

1. $b_0 = 1$ (from the initial condition).
2. For $n \geq 1$:

$$
b_n = -\sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k!} b_{n-k}
$$

And if $b_n = \frac{(-1)^n}{n!}$. Then, it is exactly the power series for $e^{-z}$:

$$
e^{-z} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-z)^n}{n!}
$$

To prove $b_n = \frac{(-1)^n}{n!}$, we use induction method. Suppose it is true for $n$, then using

$$
(1 + (-1))^{n+1} = \sum C_{k}^{n+1}(-1)^{n+1-k} = (n+1)! \sum_{k=0}^{n+1} \frac{(-1)^{n+1-k}}{k! (n+1-k)!}
$$

By substituting $b_k = \frac{(-1)^k}{k!}$ for $k \le n$, we have

$$
(-1)^{n+1} / (n+1)~! = -\sum_{k=1}^{n+1} \frac{1}{k!} b_{n-k}
$$

So $b_{n+1} = \frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{(n+1)!}$. Q.E.D

## 6. Expansion near pole

>

> f (z) = \sum_{n=-m}^{\infty} a_n z^n

>
> for some $m$, and that this converges in a “punctured disc” $\{ z | |z| < R, z \ne 0 \}$. Make such an expansion for $f (z) = z/(1 + z^2)$ around $z = i$ (hint: for this example we use tricks with geometric series, we don’t need the general recurrence relation).

Since $f(z)$ has a pole at $z = 0$, $h(z)$ must have a zero of order $m$ at $z = 0$

Given this, $h(z)$ can be written as $z^m k(z)$ where $k(z)$ is analytic and non-zero at $z = 0$. Therefore, $f(z)$ can be written as:

$$
f(z) = \frac{g(z)}{z^m k(z)}
$$

Since $k(z)$ is analytic and non-zero at $z = 0$, there exists a power series $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} b_n z^n$ such that $\frac{1}{k(z)} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} b_n z^n$ . This leads to:

$$
f(z) = \frac{g(z)}{z^m} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} b_n z^n = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} b_n g(z) z^{n-m}
$$

for $z \ne 0$. As $g(z)$ is analytic at $z = 0$, it can also be expanded into a power series around $z = 0$. Thus, the product of these two series results in a series of the form:

$$
f(z) = \sum_{n=-m}^{\infty} a_n z^n
$$

This series converges in some punctured disc $\{ z \,|\, |z| < R, z \ne 0 \}$ because it is the product of two convergent power series in that region.

For the specific function $f(z) = \frac{z}{1 + z^2}$, we want to expand around $z = i$

$$
f(z) = \frac{z}{(z - i)(z + i)}
$$

To expand around $z = i$, let's set $w = z - i$, so $z = w + i$. Then:

$$
f(w + i) = \frac{w + i}{ w (w + 2i)}
$$

Now, observe that:

$$
\frac{1}{w + 2i} = \frac{1}{2i} \cdot \frac{1}{1 + \frac{w}{2i}}
$$

Since $|\frac{w}{2i}| < 1$ for $|w| < 2$, we can use the geometric series expansion:

$$
\frac{1}{1 + \frac{w}{2i}} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \left(-\frac{w}{2i}\right)^n
$$

Thus, we get:

$$
f(z) = \frac{w + i}{2i w } \cdot \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \left(-\frac{w}{2i}\right)^n
$$

which will be valid in a punctured disc around $z = i$, specifically for $|z - i| < 2$ (or $|w| < 2$).
