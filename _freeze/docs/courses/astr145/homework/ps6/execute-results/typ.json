Here, you  will compare some of their fundamental properties. Assume typical white dwarfs have M ≈ M_sun and a radius comparable to Earth. For neutron stars, assume M ≈ 2 M_sun and a radius of 10 km.\n\n### Escape Velocities\n\n> Estimate the escape velocity at the surfaces of white dwarfs and neutron stars, and compare them to that of a black hole.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nusing UnitfulAstro: Msun, Rearth\n\nM_white_dwarf = 1u\"Msun\"\nM_neutron_star = 2u\"Msun\"\nM_black_hole = 10u\"Msun\"\n\nR_white_dwarf = Rearth\nR_neutron_star = 10u\"km\"\n\nv_es_white_dwarf = let M = M_white_dwarf, R = R_white_dwarf\n    @show v_es(M, R)\nend\n\nv_es_neutron_star = let M = M_neutron_star, R = R_neutron_star\n    @show v_es(M, R)\nend\n\nv_es_black_hole = let M = M_black_hole\n    R = Rsch(M)\n    @show v_es(M, R)\nend\n\nprintln(\"White dwarf to black hole: \", v_es_white_dwarf / v_es_black_hole)\nprintln(\"Neutron star to black hole: \", v_es_neutron_star / v_es_black_hole)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nv_es(M, R) = 6.450971939285288e6 m s⁻¹\nv_es(M, R) = 2.3040177082652816e8 m s⁻¹\nv_es(M, R) = 2.99792458e8 m s⁻¹\nWhite dwarf to black hole: 0.021518126180763653\nNeutron star to black hole: 0.7685375821780285\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeutron stars have the comparable escape velocity to black holes, while white dwarfs have a much lower escape velocity (1% of the black hole's).\n\n### Gravitational Acceleration\n\n> Estimate the gravitational acceleration at the surface of a white dwarf and neutron  star, and compare them with that at the Schwarzschild radius of a black hole with  M ≈ 10 M .

This raises a compelling question: how can we develop methods or technologies to trace these particles back to their origins, thereby unveiling the astrophysical processes responsible for such extreme energies?\n\n",
