Let us take μ = M1M2/(M1 + M2) is the reduced mass and M = M1 + M2 is the  total mass. You may assume that both masses are the same, M1 = M2 = 1.4 M⊙, and remain constant as the orbit evolves. The total angular momentum of the system,  assuming circular orbits, is is $L = μ \\sqrt{G M a}$, where a is the separation of the stars.  General relativity predicts that the orbit will lose angular momentum due to gravitational waves at a rate:  dL  dt = −\\frac{32}{5} \\frac{G^{7/2} μ^2 M^{5/2}  }{c^5 a^{7/2}} , (5)  (You don’t need to derive this!)  (a) Because the masses are constant, gravitational waves cause the orbital radius to  decrease. By taking the derivative of L(t) for a binary in a circular orbit, show that  dL / dt =  √ ( G M_1^3 / 2)  \\frac{1}{2 √a(t)}  da / dt .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nfunction t_merge(M, a0)\n    5 * (c^5 * a0^4) / (512 * G^3 * M^3) |> u\"yr\"\nend\n\n\n\"\"\"binary’s orbital period Pb\"\"\"\nfunction P_b(M, a0)\n    sqrt(4 * pi^2 * a0^3 / G / M) |> u\"yr\"\nend\n\n@show t_merge(1.4u\"Msun\", 1e7u\"m\")\n\na0 = 3e9u\"m\"\n\n@show P_b(2.8u\"Msun\", a0) |> u\"hr\"\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nt_merge(1.4 * u\"Msun\", 1.0e7 * u\"m\") = 1.1683704968163275 yr\nP_b(2.8 * u\"Msun\", a0) |> u\"hr\" = 14.87731015234723 hr\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=1}\n```\n14.87731015234723 hr\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nfunction dPbdt(M, Pb)\n    -192 * pi / 2^(1 / 3) / 5 * (G * M / c^3)^(5 / 3) * (2 * pi / Pb)^(5 / 3) |> upreferred\nend\n\nlet M = 1.4u\"Msun\", Pb = 8u\"hr\"\n    @show dPbdt(M, Pb)\nend\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\ndPbdt(M, Pb) = -1.8912371970169034e-13 s⁻¹ᐟ⁴⁵⁰³⁵⁹⁹⁶²⁷³⁷⁰⁴⁹⁶\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=1}\n```\n-1.8912371970169034e-13 s⁻¹ᐟ⁴⁵⁰³⁵⁹⁹⁶²⁷³⁷⁰⁴⁹⁶\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Gamma-Ray Bursts\n\nThe traditional classification of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) into short and long categories has been challenged by recent observations. Notably, GRB 230307A, a long-duration burst lasting approximately 200 seconds, was linked to the merger of two neutron stars—a phenomenon typically associated with short GRBs. This event, observed by NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope, also marked the first detection of the heavy element tellurium from such a merger, highlighting the role of these cosmic events in synthesizing heavy elements.\n\n",
