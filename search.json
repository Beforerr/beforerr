    "text": "Question 2\n\nFor a day/time of interestNote1 from THEMIS or MMS, based on your perusal of the overview plots at the mission website, and using standard tools:\n\nPlot SCM time-series data in 2 different coordinate systems: one that you introduce from L2 files and one you create by rotating the data using cotrans (e.g., GSE and SM coord’s).\nDo a time-series spectrogram of a SCM component in some geophysical coordinates in survey and burst mode up to a high frequency, several kHz (use waveburst from THEMIS or “hb” from MMS).\nSelect a time when the geophysical signal (plasma waves) is at minimum (a quiet period) by looking at the dynamic power spectrum first. Compare the quiet time spectrum (a line spectrum) plot with published instrument noise curves: Point out the characteristic noise curve, a decreasing noise density as a function of frequency at low frequencies, a minimum near the resonance, and an increasing noise level at high frequencies – does it match expectation? Can you point out the plasma waves in the dynamic power spectrum?\n\nNote1: A good day for THEMIS is the first results Space Sci.

The noise equivalent magnetic induction (NEMI or sensitivity) of the search-coil antenna is less than or equal to : 2 pT/sqrt(Hz) at 10 Hz, 0.3 pT/sqrt(Hz) at 100 Hz and 0.05 pT/sqrt(Hz) at 1 kHz (Fig. 6). The SCM resolution at 1k Hz is 0.15pT.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.

It mathchs expectation and looks quite like the NEMI from publications : resonance near 1kz with minimum noise level, together with a decreasing noise density at low frequencies, and an increasing noise level at high frequencies.\nFrom the quickplot spectrum, we can see there are some waves of 50-200 Hz between 13:06:50 and 13:07:00. Also observed is weak wave near 800 hz before 13:05:40.\n\n\nCode\ndata = get_data(tvar_tdpwrspc[0], xarray=True)\nquiet_time_data = data.sel(time='2015-10-16T13:06:16')\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\nax.loglog(quiet_time_data.spec_bins.data[0], np.sqrt(quiet_time_data.data[0])*1000)\n\nax.set_xlabel(\"Freq (Hz)\")\nax.set_ylabel(\"NEMI (pT/sqrt(Hz))\")\nplt.show()",

Solve this recurrence relation for \\(1/e^z\\) and show it gives the power series for \\(e^{−z}\\).\n\nThe product \\(ab\\) can be written as:\n\\[\nab = \\left(1 + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} a_n z^n \\right) \\left( \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} b_n z^n \\right) = 1\n\\]\nBy expanding, we get:\n\\[\nab = b_0 + (b_1 + a_1 b_0) z + (b_2 + a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_0) z^2 + \\dots + \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k b_{n-k} \\right) z^n + \\dots\n\\]\nFor \\(ab = 1\\), all the coefficients of \\(z^n\\) (for \\(n \\geq 1\\)) must be zero, and the constant term (the coefficient of \\(z^0\\)) must be 1. This gives us the following conditions:\n\n\\(b_0 = 1\\) (since the constant term of \\(ab\\) must be 1).\nFor \\(n \\geq 1\\), we have \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k b_{n-k} = 0\\).\n\nFor \\(a_k\\), we have \\(a_0 = 1\\) and \\(a_n\\) for \\(n \\geq 1\\). Thus, the recurrence relation for \\(b_n\\) becomes:\n\\[\nb_n = -\\sum_{k=1}^{n} a_k b_{n-k} \\quad \\text{for } n \\geq 1\n\\]\nFor \\(a = e^z\\). The power series for \\(b= 1/e^z\\) is given by:\n\n\\(b_0 = 1\\) (from the initial condition).\nFor \\(n \\geq 1\\):\n\n\\[\nb_n = -\\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{k!} b_{n-k}\n\\]\nAnd if \\(b_n = \\frac{(-1)^n}{n!}\\). Then, it is exactly the power series for \\(e^{-z}\\):\n\\[\ne^{-z} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-z)^n}{n!}\n\\]\nTo prove \\(b_n = \\frac{(-1)^n}{n!}\\), we use induction method. Suppose it is true for \\(n\\), then using\n\\[\n(1 + (-1))^{n+1} = \\sum C_{k}^{n+1}(-1)^{n+1-k} = (n+1)! \\sum_{k=0}^{n+1} \\frac{(-1)^{n+1-k}}{k! (n+1-k)!}\n\\]\nBy substituting \\(b_k = \\frac{(-1)^k}{k!}\\) for \\(k \\le n\\), we have\n\\[\n(-1)^{n+1} / (n+1)~! = -\\sum_{k=1}^{n+1} \\frac{1}{k!} b_{n-k}\n\\]\nSo \\(b_{n+1} = \\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{(n+1)!}\\).

    "text": "6. Expansion near pole\n\nAssuming the result of problem 5 and the bonus problem, show that if \\(f (z) = g(z)/h(z)\\) has a pole at \\(z = 0\\), that we can expand \\(f(z)\\) in a series\n\\[\nf (z) = \\sum_{n=-m}^{\\infty} a_n z^n\n\\]\nfor some \\(m\\), and that this converges in a “punctured disc” \\(\\{ z | |z| &lt; R, z \\ne 0 \\}\\). Make such an expansion for \\(f (z) = z/(1 + z^2)\\) around \\(z = i\\) (hint: for this example we use tricks with geometric series, we don’t need the general recurrence relation).\n\nSince \\(f(z)\\) has a pole at \\(z = 0\\), \\(h(z)\\) must have a zero of order \\(m\\) at \\(z = 0\\)\nGiven this, \\(h(z)\\) can be written as \\(z^m k(z)\\) where \\(k(z)\\) is analytic and non-zero at \\(z = 0\\). Therefore, \\(f(z)\\) can be written as:\n\\[\nf(z) = \\frac{g(z)}{z^m k(z)}\n\\]\nSince \\(k(z)\\) is analytic and non-zero at \\(z = 0\\), there exists a power series \\(\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} b_n z^n\\) such that \\(\\frac{1}{k(z)} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} b_n z^n\\) . This leads to:\n\\[\nf(z) = \\frac{g(z)}{z^m} \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} b_n z^n = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} b_n g(z) z^{n-m}\n\\]\nfor \\(z \\ne 0\\). As \\(g(z)\\) is analytic at \\(z = 0\\), it can also be expanded into a power series around \\(z = 0\\). Thus, the product of these two series results in a series of the form:\n\\[\nf(z) = \\sum_{n=-m}^{\\infty} a_n z^n\n\\]\nThis series converges in some punctured disc \\(\\{ z \\,|\\, |z| &lt; R, z \\ne 0 \\}\\) because it is the product of two convergent power series in that region.\nFor the specific function \\(f(z) = \\frac{z}{1 + z^2}\\), we want to expand around \\(z = i\\)\n\\[\nf(z) = \\frac{z}{(z - i)(z + i)}\n\\]\nTo expand around \\(z = i\\), let’s set \\(w = z - i\\), so \\(z = w + i\\). Then:\n\\[\nf(w + i) = \\frac{w + i}{ w (w + 2i)}\n\\]\nNow, observe that:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{w + 2i} = \\frac{1}{2i} \\cdot \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{w}{2i}}\n\\]\nSince \\(|\\frac{w}{2i}| &lt; 1\\) for \\(|w| &lt; 2\\), we can use the geometric series expansion:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{w}{2i}} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\left(-\\frac{w}{2i}\\right)^n\n\\]\nThus, we get:\n\\[\nf(z) = \\frac{w + i}{2i w } \\cdot \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\left(-\\frac{w}{2i}\\right)^n\n\\]\nwhich will be valid in a punctured disc around \\(z = i\\), specifically for \\(|z - i| &lt; 2\\) (or \\(|w| &lt; 2\\)).",

    "text": "If a thin Aluminum layer is deposited over a solid-state detector active area, the energy loss by the particle in that Al layer will not be recorded. The shorter the range of a particle the more the relative energy that will be missed. The range depends on mass near the last portion of the flight: heavier ions stop earlier. Two detectors, a bare one and one with an Al layer, measuring the same beam could give very different results for He+ or O+.\nPlot the energy recorded (past the Al) versus the incident energy, for beams of various energies, and for different thickness (10nm, 100nm, …). Use H+, He+, O+. Demonstrate that with a sufficient number of detectors you could differentiate monoenergetic protons, He+ and O+. Use SPENVIS or GEANT-4 for your modeling.\nBonus: simulate the number of detectors required to deconvolve the effects of a single, thermalized (not beam) distribution with dE/E~100%.\n\nDirections\nThis will be done by creating a plot of energy deposited in Si as function of input energy. You will use freeware Geant-4 which simulates particle interaction with matter, through a portal: SPENVIS. Various models exist there (very useful site!).\nFirst you have to register, then create a project, then input your model input and output parameters, then make a run and get results one-energy-at-a-time. Once you know how to do that, then you must create an array of inputs and outputs outside of SPENVIS in your favorite plotting package (e.g., excel, python or other). You will then record those results and plot them, one array for protons, another for He+ and another for O+. You can try other species as well, for example O2+ which may be present in the low altitude ionosphere.\n\nAssume monoenergetic beams. The program allows you to use a simple ion spectrum. (For the bonus question you have to make a guess on the instrument response function, model it in a simple analytical form, then prove it can be done using Geant-4. You do not have to do the bonus.)\n\nFor your outline, make sure you can obtain results, understand the problem enough to present the requested report structure, before actually doing the plots. Present a statement of task, the process and the expected results to be plotted.\nFor your report, you should not repeat the steps I mention below, but just execute your outline above and go right to the findings, plots and discussion. In the discussion explain how you use the model to design a detector system (how many detectors, thicknesses, orientations etc) that does the job.\n\nOn SPENVIS after registration, name your project and proceed to use Geant-4 “MULASSIS”. You can save your run, and come back to it later.\nYour system will be a 3 layer system, where the first layer is air, the second Al of variable thickness and the third Silicon of a mm or two... enough to stop the highest energy of interest. You shoot some particles (10,000 is a good number), and record how much energy is deposited in Si. Excluding losses in the Si (phonons) the lost energy is mainly due to losses in the Aluminum. Pick the source parameters: How many/which ions, charge angle (-22 deg -&gt; 22 deg).\nFor Geometry you pick the layers above, and for Al choose 0, 1, 10 100 nm, one thickness at a time.\nSpecify the input as monoenergetic beam.\nSpecify analysis parameters as mean energy (the mean energy deposited based on the 10,000 particle run)\nCreate a macro (a bunch of commands that tell Geant-4 what to do) and Run.\nSee the plot\nOutput results (2 numbers) into your program next to input energy to build the in/out energy curve.\nRepeat, one point at a time.\nPlot results for one species and then (in different color) for other species.\nRepeat for different Al thicknesses.\n\n\n\nGeometry Definition\nSource particles\n\nHe+\n\nAtomic number: 2\nNucleon number: 4\n\n\nMaterial Definition\nhttps://www.spenvis.oma.be/restricted/load_result.php/EPSS265/spenvis_mul-rmt.txt\nhttps://www.spenvis.oma.be/spenvis/htusers/b/beforerr/EPSS265/1699989981/spenvis_mlo.txt\n\n\n\nCode\nimport yaml\n\nwith open(\"config.yaml\", 'r') as stream:\n    config = yaml.safe_load(stream)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nuser = config[\"user\"]\nproject = config[\"project\"]\nrun = config[\"run\"]\nfiles = config[\"files\"]\n\noutput = files[\"output\"]\nreport = files[\"report\"]\n\nbase_url = config[\"base_url\"]\nurl_pattern = config[\"url_pattern\"]\n\nprint(\n    url_pattern.format(\n        base_url=base_url,\n        user=user,\n        project=project,\n        run=run,\n        filename=output[\"filename\"],\n    )\n)\n\nprint(\n    url_pattern.format(\n        base_url=base_url,\n        user=user,\n        project=project,\n        run=run,\n        filename=report[\"filename\"],\n    )\n)\n\n\nhttps://www.spenvis.oma.be/spenvis/htusers/b//beforerr/EPSS265/1699990533/spenvis_mlo.txt\nhttps://www.spenvis.oma.be/spenvis/htusers/b//beforerr/EPSS265/1699990533/spenvis_mul-rmt.txt\n\n\n\n’*‘, 10, 4, 0, 0, 5, 5, 3, 0 ’DOSE ANALYSIS’ ‘MULASSIS v1.23’ ‘geant4-09-05-patch-02 (22-October-2012)’ ‘File Created: Wed Nov 15 23:11:52 2023’\n‘End of File’\n\n\nSPENVIS generated macrofile for MULASSIS\n/geometry/layer/delete 0 /geometry/material/addNIST G4_Al /geometry/material/addNIST G4_Si /geometry/layer/shape slab /geometry/layer/add 0 Vacuum 1 1.000E+00 mm /geometry/layer/add 1 G4_Al 2 1.000E-03 um /geometry/layer/add 2 G4_Si 3 1.000E+00 mm # Total thickness = 2.000 mm /analysis/file spenvis # # Analysis definition #",

Laurent series and singularity\nLet’s consider a function \\(f\\) that is holomorphic in a disc around \\(z_0\\) except at \\(z_0\\) itself.\n\nRemovable Singularity:\nIf \\(f\\) has a removable singularity at \\(z_0\\), it means that \\(f\\) can be extended to a holomorphic function at \\(z_0\\). In terms of the Laurent series, this implies that all the coefficients \\(a_n\\) for \\(n &lt; 0\\) are zero because it reduces to its Taylor series.\nConversely, if all \\(a_n = 0\\) for \\(n &lt; 0\\), the Laurent series reduces to a Taylor series, implying that \\(f\\) is holomorphic at \\(z_0\\) (since it can be expressed as a power series), and thus the singularity is removable.\nPole of Order \\(m\\) :\nIf \\(f\\) has a pole of order \\(m\\) at \\(z_0\\), it means that in the Laurent series, there is a term with \\((z - z_0)^{-m}\\) (where \\(a_{-m} \\neq 0\\)) and no terms with higher negative powers.\nConversely, if there is some \\(m &lt; 0\\) such that \\(a_m \\neq 0\\) but \\(a_n = 0\\) for all \\(n &lt; m\\), then the Laurent series has a term \\(a_m (z - z_0)^m\\) as its term with the highest negative power, indicating a pole of order \\(m\\) .\nEssential Singularity:\nIf the singularity at \\(z_0\\) is neither removable nor a pole, it must be an essential singularity. This is characterized by the fact that there are infinitely many negative powers of \\(z - z_0\\) in the Laurent series with non-zero coefficients. In other words, if the Laurent series has non-zero \\(a_n\\) for infinitely many \\(n &lt; 0\\), then \\(z_0\\) is an essential singularity.",

    "text": "Notes\nI have released a cribsheet “myexample_FPI_mom_part_spectra” for doing moments and enegry/angle spectra calculations using pyspedas. The crib sheet (.pyspd) and its Jupytr notebook (.ipynb) along with 2 plots they produce are in mms_BE_FPI_pyspd_cribs.zip. They show you how to make moments, and energy, phi, theta, pitch angle and gyrophase spectrograms for ions and electrons from MMS L2 data.\nNote that energy spectra and moments already exist as L2 products. The routines I mention create additional angle spectrograms that are useful for analysis.\nThere are some problems with mms_part_getspec, the basic routine for doing the above spectra. (I have informed the software team and they will resolve these problems soon enough.) The major bugs are:\n\nThe ion moments computation does not produce good results (plotted in the second figure, and compared to L2 moments you can simply load and plot in the first figure) so you cannot yet trust them. The symptom is that the computed ion density is too high and the ion velocity compared to the directly-loaded ion moments. This may be simply an issue of setting the right keywords in the computation and making them default or at least documenting them. Electron moments seem fine.\nThe pitch-angle spectrogram computation for ions or electrons does not produce anything. I have commented out the calls producing them.\n\nThe crib sheet only applies the above moments and spectrogram calc’s to 5 minutes of fast survey data. Some take several minutes to complete but some take less than 1 minute. Some are un-necessarily long and I have informed the team on methods to accelerate them. For now, you can see them run one at a time and can plot the results, and digest them, while another one is running in the background.\nThese are similar to routines that already exist in IDL for both THEMIS and MMS, but in PySPEDAS only the MMS ones are currently available. The tools are generic enough and will be implemented on THEMIS and other spacecraft in the future.",

    "text": "2 Green’s function for the heat equation\n\nFind the Green’s function for the heat equation\n\\[\n\\partial_t u=\\partial_x^2 u\n\\]\nby Fourier analysis.\n\nWe want to find a Green’s function \\(G(x, t; x', t')\\) that satisfies the following properties:\n\n\\(\\partial_t G = \\partial_x^2 G\\)\n\\(G(x, t; x', t')\\) behaves like a delta function as \\(t \\to t'^+\\), i.e., \\(G(x, t; x', t') \\to \\delta(x - x')\\) as \\(t \\to t'^+\\).\n\nBy taking the Fourier transform of \\(G\\) with respect to \\(x\\), the heat equation in Fourier space becomes\n\\[\n\\partial_t \\hat{G} = -k^2 \\hat{G}\n\\]\nThis is a first-order linear differential equation in \\(t\\), the solution is\n\\[\n\\hat{G}(k, t; x', t') = A(k, x', t') e^{-k^2 (t - t')}\n\\]\nwhere \\(A(k, x', t')\\) is to be determined.\nNow we apply the initial condition. The initial condition is that \\(G\\) approaches \\(\\delta(x - x')\\) as \\(t \\to t'^+\\). In Fourier space, this translates to \\(\\hat{G}(k, t; x', t') \\to e^{-ik(x - x')}\\) as \\(t \\to t'^+\\). Thus\n\\[\nA(k, x', t') = e^{-ikx'}\n\\]\nThen take the inverse Fourier transform of \\(\\hat{G}(k, t; x', t')\\) to get back to the spatial domain:\n\\[\nG(x, t; x', t') = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-ikx'} e^{-ikx} e^{-k^2 (t - t')} dk\n\\]\nThis integral yields a function of the form:\n\\[\nG(x, t; x', t') = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4\\pi (t - t')}} e^{-\\frac{(x - x')^2}{4(t - t')}}\n\\]\nfor \\(t &gt; t'\\).\nSo the Green’s function for the heat equation is:\n\\[\nG(x, t; x', t') = \\begin{cases} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4\\pi (t - t')}} e^{-\\frac{(x - x')^2}{4(t - t')}}, & t &gt; t' \\\\ 0, & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\n\\]",

    "text": "3 Resolvent \\(R(z, A)=(z \\mathbb{1}-A)^{-1}\\)\n\nGiven a finite dimensional complex matrix \\(A\\), we can define the resolvent\n\\[\nR(z, A)=(z \\mathbb{1}-A)^{-1}=\\frac{1}{z-A},\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathbb{1}\\) is the identity matrix. This equation makes sense whenever \\(z\\) is not an eigenvalue of \\(A\\), and so we can consider \\(R(z, A)\\) as a meromorphic, matrix-valued function of \\(z\\), with poles at the eigenvalues of \\(A\\). For these problems, assume \\(A\\) is Hermitian:\n\nShow that\n\\[\nR(z, A)=\\frac{P_\\lambda}{z-\\lambda},\n\\]\nwhere \\(P_\\lambda\\) is the projector onto the eigenspace of \\(\\lambda\\) eigenvectors.\nSuppose \\(w\\) is orthogonal to the kernel of \\(A\\). Prove that\n\\[\nv=\\int_C \\frac{d z}{2 \\pi i} \\frac{R(z, A)}{z} w\n\\]\nsolves the equation\n\\[\nA v=w,\n\\]\nwhere \\(C\\) is a contour winding once around \\(z=0\\) and not enclosing any other eigenvalues.\nShow the same as in (2) for a contour enclosing all eigenvalues except for 0.\n\n\n\n3.1 Expression for \\(R(z, A)\\)\nGiven a Hermitian matrix \\(A\\), its eigenvalues are real, and it can be diagonalized. Let \\(\\lambda\\) be an eigenvalue of \\(A\\) and \\(P_\\lambda\\) the projector onto the eigenspace of \\(\\lambda\\). We have spectral decomposition\n\\[\nA = \\sum_{\\lambda} \\lambda P_\\lambda\n\\]\nthe expression for \\(R(z, A)\\) can be simplified:\n\\[\nR(z, A) = (z\\mathbb{1} - A)^{-1} = \\left( z \\sum_\\lambda P_\\lambda - \\sum_\\lambda \\lambda P_\\lambda \\right)^{-1}\n\\]\nBecause the projectors \\(P_\\lambda\\) are orthogonal and sum to the identity: \\(R(z, A) = \\sum_\\lambda (zP_\\lambda - \\lambda P_\\lambda)^{-1}\\).\n\nThus, \\(R(z, A) = \\sum_\\lambda \\frac{P_\\lambda}{z - \\lambda}\\).\n\n\n\n3.2 Solving \\(A v = w\\)\nSubstitute the expression for \\(R(z, A)\\) into the integral:\n\\[\nv = \\int_C \\frac{d z}{2 \\pi i} \\frac{\\sum_\\lambda \\frac{P_\\lambda}{z - \\lambda}}{z} w\n\\]\nEvaluate it using the residue theorem. Since \\(C\\) winds around \\(z = 0\\) and does not enclose any other eigenvalues, the only contribution comes from the pole at \\(z = 0\\).\nThe residue at \\(z = 0\\) gives \\(P_0 w\\). So \\(A v = A P_0 w = w\\)\n\n\n3.3 Contour Enclosing All Eigenvalues Except 0\nUse the same integral expression for \\(v\\). But now the integral will pick up residues from all poles \\(\\lambda \\neq 0\\) within the contour \\(C\\).\nFor each \\(\\lambda \\neq 0\\), the residue at \\(z = \\lambda\\) is \\(\\frac{P_\\lambda w}{\\lambda}\\).\nSumming up the residues, \\(v = \\sum_{\\lambda \\neq 0} \\frac{P_\\lambda w}{\\lambda}\\).\nMultiplying both sides by \\(A\\) (and using \\(AP_\\lambda = \\lambda P_\\lambda\\)), we get \\(A v = \\sum_{\\lambda \\neq 0} P_\\lambda w = w - P_0 w\\).\nSince \\(w\\) is orthogonal to the kernel of \\(A\\), \\(P_0 w = 0\\). Therefore, \\(A v = w\\).",

    "text": "6. Expansion near pole\n\nAssuming the result of problem 5 and the bonus problem, show that if \\(f (z) = g(z)/h(z)\\) has a pole at \\(z = 0\\), that we can expand \\(f(z)\\) in a series\n\\[\nf (z) = \\sum_{n=-m}^{\\infty} a_n z^n\n\\]\nfor some \\(m\\), and that this converges in a “punctured disc” \\(\\{ z | |z| &lt; R, z \\ne 0 \\}\\). Make such an expansion for \\(f (z) = z/(1 + z^2)\\) around \\(z = i\\) (hint: for this example we use tricks with geometric series, we don’t need the general recurrence relation).\n\nSince \\(f(z)\\) has a pole at \\(z = 0\\), \\(h(z)\\) must have a zero of order \\(m\\) at \\(z = 0\\)\nGiven this, \\(h(z)\\) can be written as \\(z^m k(z)\\) where \\(k(z)\\) is analytic and non-zero at \\(z = 0\\). Therefore, \\(f(z)\\) can be written as:\n\\[\nf(z) = \\frac{g(z)}{z^m k(z)}\n\\]\nSince \\(k(z)\\) is analytic and non-zero at \\(z = 0\\), there exists a power series \\(\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} b_n z^n\\) such that \\(\\frac{1}{k(z)} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} b_n z^n\\) . This leads to:\n\\[\nf(z) = \\frac{g(z)}{z^m} \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} b_n z^n = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} b_n g(z) z^{n-m}\n\\]\nfor \\(z \\ne 0\\). As \\(g(z)\\) is analytic at \\(z = 0\\), it can also be expanded into a power series around \\(z = 0\\). Thus, the product of these two series results in a series of the form:\n\\[\nf(z) = \\sum_{n=-m}^{\\infty} a_n z^n\n\\]\nThis series converges in some punctured disc \\(\\{ z \\,|\\, |z| &lt; R, z \\ne 0 \\}\\) because it is the product of two convergent power series in that region.\nFor the specific function \\(f(z) = \\frac{z}{1 + z^2}\\), we want to expand around \\(z = i\\)\n\\[\nf(z) = \\frac{z}{(z - i)(z + i)}\n\\]\nTo expand around \\(z = i\\), let’s set \\(w = z - i\\), so \\(z = w + i\\). Then:\n\\[\nf(w + i) = \\frac{w + i}{ w (w + 2i)}\n\\]\nNow, observe that:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{w + 2i} = \\frac{1}{2i} \\cdot \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{w}{2i}}\n\\]\nSince \\(|\\frac{w}{2i}| &lt; 1\\) for \\(|w| &lt; 2\\), we can use the geometric series expansion:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{w}{2i}} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\left(-\\frac{w}{2i}\\right)^n\n\\]\nThus, we get:\n\\[\nf(z) = \\frac{w + i}{2i w } \\cdot \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\left(-\\frac{w}{2i}\\right)^n\n\\]\nwhich will be valid in a punctured disc around \\(z = i\\), specifically for \\(|z - i| &lt; 2\\) (or \\(|w| &lt; 2\\)).",

For these problems, assume \\(A\\) is Hermitian:\n\nShow that\n\\[\nR(z, A)=\\frac{P_\\lambda}{z-\\lambda},\n\\]\nwhere \\(P_\\lambda\\) is the projector onto the eigenspace of \\(\\lambda\\) eigenvectors.\nSuppose \\(w\\) is orthogonal to the kernel of \\(A\\). Prove that\n\\[\nv=\\int_C \\frac{d z}{2 \\pi i} \\frac{R(z, A)}{z} w\n\\]\nsolves the equation\n\\[\nA v=w,\n\\]\nwhere \\(C\\) is a contour winding once around \\(z=0\\) and not enclosing any other eigenvalues.\nShow the same as in (2) for a contour enclosing all eigenvalues except for 0.\n\n\n\n3.1 Expression for \\(R(z, A)\\)\nGiven a Hermitian matrix \\(A\\), its eigenvalues are real, and it can be diagonalized. Let \\(\\lambda\\) be an eigenvalue of \\(A\\) and \\(P_\\lambda\\) the projector onto the eigenspace of \\(\\lambda\\). We have spectral decomposition\n\\[\nA = \\sum_{\\lambda} \\lambda P_\\lambda\n\\]\nthe expression for \\(R(z, A)\\) can be simplified:\n\\[\nR(z, A) = (z\\mathbb{1} - A)^{-1} = \\left( z \\sum_\\lambda P_\\lambda - \\sum_\\lambda \\lambda P_\\lambda \\right)^{-1}\n\\]\nBecause the projectors \\(P_\\lambda\\) are orthogonal and sum to the identity: \\(R(z, A) = \\sum_\\lambda (zP_\\lambda - \\lambda P_\\lambda)^{-1}\\).\n\nThus, \\(R(z, A) = \\sum_\\lambda \\frac{P_\\lambda}{z - \\lambda}\\).\n\n\n\n3.2 Solving \\(A v = w\\)\nSubstitute the expression for \\(R(z, A)\\) into the integral:\n\\[\nv = \\int_C \\frac{d z}{2 \\pi i} \\frac{\\sum_\\lambda \\frac{P_\\lambda}{z - \\lambda}}{z} w\n\\]\nEvaluate it using the residue theorem. Since \\(C\\) winds around \\(z = 0\\) and does not enclose any other eigenvalues, the only contribution comes from the pole at \\(z = 0\\).\nThe residue at \\(z = 0\\) gives \\(P_0 w\\). So \\(A v = A P_0 w = w\\)\n\n\n3.3 Contour Enclosing All Eigenvalues Except 0\nUse the same integral expression for \\(v\\). But now the integral will pick up residues from all poles \\(\\lambda \\neq 0\\) within the contour \\(C\\).\nFor each \\(\\lambda \\neq 0\\), the residue at \\(z = \\lambda\\) is \\(\\frac{P_\\lambda w}{\\lambda}\\).\nSumming up the residues, \\(v = \\sum_{\\lambda \\neq 0} \\frac{P_\\lambda w}{\\lambda}\\).\nMultiplying both sides by \\(A\\) (and using \\(AP_\\lambda = \\lambda P_\\lambda\\)), we get \\(A v = \\sum_{\\lambda \\neq 0} P_\\lambda w = w - P_0 w\\).\nSince \\(w\\) is orthogonal to the kernel of \\(A\\), \\(P_0 w = 0\\). Therefore, \\(A v = w\\).",

Use SPENVIS or GEANT-4 for your modeling.\n\nThe energy loss of particles depends on the nature of particles (mass, charge, etc), the incident energy, and the thickness of the Al layer.\nFor the two-layer detector, where the ﬁrst layer is Al and the second layer is Silicon, the thickness of the Al layer varies from 0 nm to 100 nm with the thickness of the Si layer ﬁxed to 2 mm.\nAs shown in Figure 1, heavier ions like O+ deposits more energy in the Al layer than lighter ions like He+ and H+, leading to a smaller energy recorded by the Si layer.\nAnd for O+ with low incoming energy below a certain energy threshold \\(E\\), the recorded deposited energy in Si layer will drop to zero. This threshold energy \\(E\\) depends on the thickness of the Al layer \\(d\\). The thicker the Al layer, the higher the threshold energy.\n\\[E=E(d)\\]\nMore generally, the threshold energy \\(E\\) also depends the incident particle \\(s\\).\n\\[E=E(d,s)\\]\n\n\nCode\nimport Pkg\nPkg.add(\"YAML\")\nPkg.add(\"DataFrames\")\nPkg.add(\"Gadfly\")\nPkg.add(\"Unitful\")\n\nusing YAML\nusing DataFrames\nusing Gadfly\nusing Unitful\n\n\n\n\nCode\nfunction parse_result_line(line)\n    values = split(line, ',')\n    Layer = parse(Int, values[1])\n    Thickness = parse(Float64, values[2])  # Assuming thickness in cm\n    Density = parse(Float64, values[3])    # Assuming density in g/cm3\n    Dose = parse(Float64, values[4])       # Assuming dose in keV\n    Error = try\n        parse(Float64, values[5])\n    catch _\n        NaN\n    end  # Handle '-nan' and other errors\n\n    return (Layer, Thickness, Density, Dose, Error)\nend\n\nfunction convert_data(yaml_data)\n    # Iterate through the data and convert each field\n    for entry in yaml_data\n        entry[\"layer.Al.thickness\"] = parse(Float64, replace(entry[\"layer.Al.thickness\"], \" um\" =&gt; \"\")) * 1000 * u\"nm\"\n        entry[\"source\"][\"energy\"] = parse(Float64, replace(entry[\"source\"][\"energy\"], \" MeV\" =&gt; \"\")) * 1000\n        entry[\"result\"] = [parse_result_line(line) for line in split(entry[\"result\"], '\\n') if line != \"\"]\n    end\n\n    df = DataFrame(\n        IncidentEnergy=[entry[\"source\"][\"energy\"] for entry in yaml_data],\n        DepositedEnergy=[entry[\"result\"][3][4] for entry in yaml_data],\n        SourceParticle=[entry[\"source\"][\"particle\"] for entry in yaml_data],\n        LayerAlThickness=[entry[\"layer.Al.thickness\"] for entry in yaml_data],\n    )\n    \n    return df\nend\n\n\nconvert_data (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nfunction read_data(filename = \"result.yml\")\n    # Read YAML file or string\n    filepath = joinpath(@__DIR__, \"run\", filename)\n    # Parse YAML content\n    parsed_data = YAML.load_file(filepath)\n\n    # Convert data to DataFrame\n    df = convert_data(parsed_data)\n\n    return df\nend\n\n\nread_data (generic function with 2 methods)\n\n\nThe result from SPENVIS is stored in a yaml file.

    "text": "Plot the energy recorded (past the Al) versus the incident energy, for beams of various energies, and for different thickness (10nm, 100nm, …). Use H+, He+, O+. Use SPENVIS or GEANT-4 for your modeling.\n\nThe energy loss of particles depends on the nature of particles (mass, charge, etc), the incident energy, and the thickness of the Al layer.\nFor the two-layer detector, where the ﬁrst layer is Al and the second layer is Silicon, the thickness of the Al layer varies from 0 nm to 100 nm with the thickness of the Si layer ﬁxed to 2 mm.\nAs shown in Figure 1, heavier ions like O+ deposits more energy in the Al layer than lighter ions like He+ and H+, leading to a smaller energy recorded by the Si layer.\nAnd for O+ with low incoming energy below a certain energy threshold \\(E\\), the recorded deposited energy in Si layer will drop to zero. This threshold energy \\(E\\) depends on the thickness of the Al layer \\(d\\). The thicker the Al layer, the higher the threshold energy.\n\\[E=E(d)\\]\nMore generally, the threshold energy \\(E\\) also depends the incident particle \\(s\\).\n\\[E=E(d,s)\\]\n\n\nCode\nimport Pkg\nPkg.add(\"YAML\")\nPkg.add(\"DataFrames\")\nPkg.add(\"Gadfly\")\nPkg.add(\"Unitful\")\n\nusing YAML\nusing DataFrames\nusing Gadfly\nusing Unitful\n\n\n\n\nCode\nfunction parse_result_line(line)\n    values = split(line, ',')\n    Layer = parse(Int, values[1])\n    Thickness = parse(Float64, values[2])  # Assuming thickness in cm\n    Density = parse(Float64, values[3])    # Assuming density in g/cm3\n    Dose = parse(Float64, values[4])       # Assuming dose in keV\n    Error = try\n        parse(Float64, values[5])\n    catch _\n        NaN\n    end  # Handle '-nan' and other errors\n\n    return (Layer, Thickness, Density, Dose, Error)\nend\n\nfunction convert_data(yaml_data)\n    # Iterate through the data and convert each field\n    for entry in yaml_data\n        entry[\"layer.Al.thickness\"] = parse(Float64, replace(entry[\"layer.Al.thickness\"], \" um\" =&gt; \"\")) * 1000 * u\"nm\"\n        entry[\"source\"][\"energy\"] = parse(Float64, replace(entry[\"source\"][\"energy\"], \" MeV\" =&gt; \"\")) * 1000\n        entry[\"result\"] = [parse_result_line(line) for line in split(entry[\"result\"], '\\n') if line != \"\"]\n    end\n\n    df = DataFrame(\n        IncidentEnergy=[entry[\"source\"][\"energy\"] for entry in yaml_data],\n        DepositedEnergy=[entry[\"result\"][3][4] for entry in yaml_data],\n        SourceParticle=[entry[\"source\"][\"particle\"] for entry in yaml_data],\n        LayerAlThickness=[entry[\"layer.Al.thickness\"] for entry in yaml_data],\n    )\n    \n    return df\nend\n\n\nconvert_data (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nfunction read_data(filename = \"result.yml\")\n    # Read YAML file or string\n    filepath = joinpath(@__DIR__, \"run\", filename)\n    # Parse YAML content\n    parsed_data = YAML.load_file(filepath)\n\n    # Convert data to DataFrame\n    df = convert_data(parsed_data)\n\n    return df\nend\n\n\nread_data (generic function with 2 methods)\n\n\nThe result from SPENVIS is stored in a yaml file.

    "text": "Differentiate monoenergetic ions\n\nDemonstrate that with a sufficient number of detectors you could differentiate monoenergetic protons, He+ and O+.\n\nAssuming the Protons constitute \\(n_1\\) percen, He+ \\(n_2\\), and O+ \\(n_3\\) of the incoming beam. For three unknown variables \\(n_1\\), \\(n_2\\), \\(n_3\\), we need at least three detectors to solve the equation system. With the first detector recording the total incoming energy \\(E_1\\), the second detector \\(E_2\\), and the third detector \\(E_3\\), we have the following equation system:\n\\[E_1 = n_1 E + n_2 E + n_3 E\\] \\[E_2 = n_1 \\alpha_{2,p} E + n_2 \\alpha_{2,He+} E + n_3 \\alpha_{2,O+} E\\] \\[E_3 = n_1 \\alpha_{3,p} E + n_2 \\alpha_{3,He+} E + n_3 \\alpha_{3,O+} E\\]\nwhere \\(\\alpha_{2,p}\\), \\(\\alpha_{2,He+}\\), \\(\\alpha_{2,O+}\\), \\(\\alpha_{3,p}\\), \\(\\alpha_{3,He+}\\), \\(\\alpha_{3,O+}\\) are 1- the energy loss ratio of protons, He+ and O+ in the Al layer of the second and third detector respectively.\nSince \\(\\alpha_{i,p}\\) can be determined from experiment/simulation, we can solve the above equation to get \\(n_1\\), \\(n_2\\), \\(n_3\\).\nIf we want to well differentiate monoenergetic protons, He+ and O+ with energy \\(E\\), we can reverse the relationship \\(E=E(d,s)\\) to get the thickness of the Al layer \\(d\\) for each ion. This is possible because theoretically the threshold energy \\(E\\) is a monotonic increasing function of the thickness of the Al layer \\(d\\).\n\\[d=d(E,s)\\]\nSo for a detector with a thickness \\(d_{O+}=d(E,O+)\\) of the Al layer, we only detect the deposited energy of protons and He+ in the Si layer. And for a detector with a thickness \\(d_{He+}=d(E,He+)\\) of the Al layer, we only detect the deposited energy of protons in the Si layer.\nThen we have additional \\(\\alpha_{2,O+}=0\\) and \\(\\alpha_{3,O+}=\\alpha_{3,He+}=0\\) in the equation system, simplifying the equation system to:\n\\[E_1 = n_1 E + n_2 E + n_3 E\\] \\[E_2 = n_1 \\alpha_{2,p} E + n_2 \\alpha_{2,He+} E\\] \\[E_3 = n_1 \\alpha_{3,p} E\\]\nTo demonstrate the differentiation, suppose the energy of the incoming beam is \\(E=100\\) keV.\nFrom the Figure 2, we can use the following thickness of the Al layer to differentiate the three ions:\n\n\\(d_{1} = d_{O+} \\approx 300 nm\\)\n\\(d_{2} = d_{He+} \\approx 610 nm\\)\n\nAnd we have \\(\\alpha_{2,p} \\approx 0.59\\), \\(\\alpha_{2,He+} \\approx 0.38\\) and \\(\\alpha_{3,p} \\approx 0.22\\) from the simulation. The equation is solvable.\n\n\nCode\ndf2 = read_data(\"result_2.yml\")\n\n\n15×4

You will use freeware Geant-4 which simulates particle interaction with matter, through a portal: SPENVIS. Various models exist there (very useful site!).\nFirst you have to register, then create a project, then input your model input and output parameters, then make a run and get results one-energy-at-a-time. Once you know how to do that, then you must create an array of inputs and outputs outside of SPENVIS in your favorite plotting package (e.g., excel, python or other). You will then record those results and plot them, one array for protons, another for He+ and another for O+. You can try other species as well, for example O2+ which may be present in the low altitude ionosphere.\n\nAssume monoenergetic beams. The program allows you to use a simple ion spectrum. (For the bonus question you have to make a guess on the instrument response function, model it in a simple analytical form, then prove it can be done using Geant-4. You do not have to do the bonus.)\n\nFor your report, you should not repeat the steps I mention below, but just execute your outline above and go right to the findings, plots and discussion. In the discussion explain how you use the model to design a detector system (how many detectors, thicknesses, orientations etc) that does the job.\n\nOn SPENVIS after registration, name your project and proceed to use Geant-4 “MULASSIS”. You can save your run, and come back to it later.\nYour system will be a 3 layer system, where the first layer is air, the second Al of variable thickness and the third Silicon of a mm or two... enough to stop the highest energy of interest. You shoot some particles (10,000 is a good number), and record how much energy is deposited in Si. Excluding losses in the Si (phonons) the lost energy is mainly due to losses in the Aluminum. Pick the source parameters: How many/which ions, charge angle (-22 deg -&gt; 22 deg).\nFor Geometry you pick the layers above, and for Al choose 0, 1, 10 100 nm, one thickness at a time.\nSpecify the input as monoenergetic beam.\nSpecify analysis parameters as mean energy (the mean energy deposited based on the 10,000 particle run)\nCreate a macro (a bunch of commands that tell Geant-4 what to do) and Run.\nSee the plot\nOutput results (2 numbers) into your program next to input energy to build the in/out energy curve.\nRepeat, one point at a time.\nPlot results for one species and then (in different color) for other species.\nRepeat for different Al thicknesses.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Moon, charactered by an absence of magnetosphere and atmosphere, sits directly exposed to the surrounding solar wind and/or magnetospheric plasma as the Moon revolved around the Earth. Therefore, the lunar space environment is mainly shaped by the interaction between the lunar surface and the impinging plasma. Previously, the Moon was thought as a passive absorber of the solar wind, forming a nearly complete void downstream called lunar wake. However, recent mission revealed a more complicated and diverse interaction between the Moon and the solar wind, such as the reflection and deflection of solar wind protons, formation of ”mini-magnetospheres” and collisionless shocks around lunar magnetic anomalies (LMAs). These new observation sparks a new interest to the lunar plasma environment research.\nIn the present thesis, we investigate the interaction between the solar wind and lunar crustal magnetic anomalies. We use particle-in-cell simulation to study a simplified but typical scenario of the interaction between a magnetic dipolar embedded in the lunar regolith and solar wind. We confirm that LMAs may indeed be strong enough to stand off the solar wind from directly striking the lunar surface under typical solar wind conditions and form a mini-magnetosphere structure. The analysis of the miniature magnetosphere and parameter influence offers insight into kinetic multi-scale physical processes in the planetary magnetic structures."

This pattern is known as ‘‘Joy’s law’’. The tilt of the magnetic axis of a BMR implies a non-zero projection along the N–S direction, which amounts to a dipole moment. The decay of BMRs and subsequent dispersal of their magnetic ﬂux by surface ﬂows can release a fraction of this dipole moment and contribute to the global dipole."

    "text": "Tension(s): From Solar to Stellar Dynamos\n\nBabcock–Leighton mechanism\n\nThe net effect of BMRs is taking a formerly toroidal internal magnetic ﬁeld and converting a fraction of its associated ﬂux into a net surface dipole moment.\n\nThe larger sunspot pairs (‘‘bipolar magnetic regions’’, hereafter BMR) often emerge with a systematic tilt with respect to the E–W direction, in that on average, the leading sunspot (with respect to the direction of solar rotation) is located at a lower latitude than the trailing sunspot, the more so the higher the latitude of the emerging BMR (see, e.g., Stenﬂo and Kosovichev 2012; McClintock and Norton 2013). This pattern is known as ‘‘Joy’s law’’. The tilt of the magnetic axis of a BMR implies a non-zero projection along the N–S direction, which amounts to a dipole moment. The decay of BMRs and subsequent dispersal of their magnetic ﬂux by surface ﬂows can release a fraction of this dipole moment and contribute to the global dipole."

These interactions often lead to significant modulation of electron fluxes, contributing to both electron acceleration and loss. This study aims to deepen the understanding of how EMIC waves, in concert with other wave modes such as whistler-mode chorus waves and phenomena like plasma sheet injections, impact the behavior of radiation belt electrons during various geomagnetic conditions. Leveraging extensive datasets from satellites such as the Van Allen Probes, ERG (Arase), MMS, and ELFIN, this study will conduct a comprehensive analysis of wave properties, and the resulting effects on electron fluxes. By integrating observational data with advanced simulation techniques, the project seeks to enhance current models of radiation belt dynamics, improving predictions of space weather effects."

    "section": "Background and Motivation",
    "text": "Background and Motivation\nThe dynamic environments of Earth’s radiation belts are shaped by a complex interplay of different types of waves and particle populations. Among these, Electromagnetic Ion Cyclotron (EMIC) waves play a pivotal role in the energy dynamics of radiation belt electrons. These waves, primarily generated through instabilities associated with the anisotropic temperature distribution of ions, have been the focus of significant research due to their ability to effectively resonate with high-energy electrons (Millan & Thorne, 2007; Jordanova et al., 2010).\nOrigin and Characteristics of EMIC Waves:\nEMIC waves arise predominantly during geomagnetic storms when rapid injections of energetic ions from the solar wind into the magnetosphere create temperature anisotropies (Cornwall et al., 1970; Anderson et al., 1996). These waves have been observed in different frequency bands corresponding to the ion species (H+, He+, O+) that drive them, each influencing different electron populations within the radiation belts. The interaction of these waves with electrons, particularly through resonant scattering, can lead to significant modifications in electron pitch angles and energies, contributing to both acceleration and loss processes.\nInteractions with Radiation Belt Electrons:\nThe resonance with radiation belt electrons typically results in increased pitch angle scattering, particularly for electrons at energies of hundreds of keV to several MeV. This scattering can fill the loss cone and lead to electron precipitation into the Earth’s atmosphere, effectively depleting the radiation belt populations (Thorne et al., 2005; Summers et al., 2007). Furthermore, recent studies have highlighted that under certain conditions, EMIC waves can also accelerate electrons to ultra-relativistic energies through mechanisms that are not yet fully understood and are a current area of active research (Miyoshi et al., 2013; Foster et al., 2014).\nRole of EMIC Waves in Space Weather:\nUnderstanding the interactions between EMIC waves and radiation belt electrons is crucial for predicting space weather effects, particularly since these interactions can lead to rapid changes in radiation belt configurations, posing risks to satellites and other space-based technologies (Baker et al., 2004; Horne et al., 2005). The 2003 Halloween storm provided a clear example of how enhanced EMIC wave activity correlated with significant radiation belt electron flux decreases, highlighting the importance of including these waves in predictive models (Turner et al., 2012).\nGaps in Current Understanding:\nDespite significant advances, there remain substantial gaps in our understanding of the conditions under which EMIC waves are most effective at causing electron losses and what roles other concurrent processes (e.g., whistler-mode chorus waves and plasma sheet injections) play in modifying these interactions. The proposed study aims to bridge these gaps by combining observational data analysis with theoretical modeling efforts.\nThis enriched background sets a solid foundation for investigating the interactions of EMIC waves with radiation belt electrons and underscores the importance of this research in advancing our understanding of magnetospheric physics and improving our ability to forecast space weather impacts effectively."

    "text": "Abstract\nElectromagnetic Ion Cyclotron (EMIC) waves and whistler waves are fundamental plasma wave phenomena in Earth’s magnetosphere, influencing the dynamics of radiation belts through interactions with energetic electrons. These interactions often lead to significant modulation of electron fluxes, with chorus waves accelerating electrons to relativistic energies (Miyoshi et al. 2003; Sorathia et al. 2018) and EMIC & whistler waves causing electron losses through pitch angle scattering (Summers and Thorne 2003; Summers, Ni, and Meredith 2007b). This study aims to deepen the understanding of how these waves, in concert with other phenomena like plasma sheet injections, impact the behavior of radiation belt electrons. Leveraging extensive datasets from satellites such as the Van Allen Probes, ERG (Arase), MMS, and ELFIN, this study will conduct a comprehensive analysis of wave properties, and the resulting effects on electron fluxes. By integrating observational data with advanced simulation techniques, the project seeks to enhance current models of radiation belt dynamics, improving predictions of space weather effects."

    "section": "Background and Motivation",
    "text": "Background and Motivation\nInteractions of Waves with Radiation Belt Electrons:\nRelativistic electron fluxes in Earth’s inner magnetosphere are greatly affected by electron scattering to the atmosphere via resonant interactions with whistler-mode and electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves (Millan and Thorne 2007; Summers, Ni, and Meredith 2007a). Near the loss-cone, electron scattering rates for EMIC waves at such energies are much larger than for whistler-mode waves (Glauert and Horne 2005). Thus, EMIC wave-driven electron precipitation is considered a key contributor to relativistic electron losses at energies exceeding the minimum energy for cyclotron resonance with such waves, \\(E_{\\min}\\sim 0.5-1\\) MeV (Summers and Thorne 2003; Summers, Ni, and Meredith 2007b). Numerical simulations of the outer radiation belt dynamics (Ma et al. 2015) and data-model comparisons (Angelopoulos et al. 2023) have demonstrated that EMIC waves can scatter relativistic electrons efficiently and deplete their fluxes quickly in the outer radiation belt.\nFor energies below ultra-relativistic energies (below several MeV) and for typical plasma characteristics, EMIC wave-driven electron scattering mostly affects low pitch-angle electrons (equatorial \\(\\alpha_{eq}&lt;30^\\circ\\), see Kersten et al. 2014). Therefore, additional high pitch-angle electron scattering by whistler-mode waves is required to assist EMIC waves in the precipitation of the main, near-equatorial, (trapped) electron population (Mourenas et al. 2016). A combination of electron scattering by whistler-mode and EMIC waves at the same \\(L\\)-shell (even if at different longitudes) can result in a very effective electron flux depletion (Mourenas et al. 2016; Drozdov et al. 2022). Verification of this electron loss mechanism requires a combination of satellites near the equator (to measure the waves and equatorial pitch-angle electron fluxes) and at low-altitude (to measure precipitating electron fluxes).\nOrigin and Characteristics of Waves:\n\nEMIC waves are often generated by anisotropic ion populations from plasma sheet injections . These injections also create anisotropic “seed” electrons , the free energy source for whistler-mode chorus waves . Such chorus waves can effectively accelerate the same seed electrons to relativistic energies \\cite&lt;e.g.,&gt;{Miyoshi03,Thorne13:nature,Li14:storm,Mourenas14:fluxes,Allison&Shprits20}. Therefore, there is a competition between electron acceleration by whistler-mode waves \\cite&lt;supported by direct adiabatic heating during injections, see, e.g.&gt;{Sorathia18} and electron precipitation by EMIC and chorus waves, and this competition should ultimately shape the energy spectrum of radiation belt electrons after a series of plasma sheet injections. Several recent publications indicate that the electron energy spectrum may have an upper limit corresponding to a balance between electron injections and precipitation loss, controlled by whistler-mode waves . The existence of such an upper limit has been predicted by Kennel and Petschek (1966), and reevaluated for relativistic electrons by Summers, Tang, and Thorne (2009) and Summers and Shi (2014). Several of its main assumptions have been verified using ELFIN data . The Kennel-Petschek upper limit is based on the idea that injected electrons generate whistler-mode waves (with exponentially higher wave power for electron fluxes above the flux limit) that ultimately scatter these same injected electrons into the atmosphere. The competition between linearly increasing anisotropic electron fluxes and exponentially faster electron losses into the atmosphere due to exponentially increasing wave growth, leads to a stationary solution in the diffusion (Fokker-Planck) equation describing electron flux dynamics. Inclusion of EMIC wave-driven loss into this balance reduces the upper limit of the electron flux at high energy .\nRole of EMIC Waves in Space Weather:\nUnderstanding the interactions between EMIC waves and radiation belt electrons is crucial for predicting space weather effects, particularly since these interactions can lead to rapid changes in radiation belt configurations, posing risks to satellites and other space-based technologies (Baker et al., 2004; Horne et al., 2005). The 2003 Halloween storm provided a clear example of how enhanced EMIC wave activity correlated with significant radiation belt electron flux decreases, highlighting the importance of including these waves in predictive models (Turner et al., 2012).\nGaps in Current Understanding:\nDespite significant advances, there remain substantial gaps in our understanding of the conditions under which EMIC waves are most effective at causing electron losses and what roles other concurrent processes (e.g., whistler-mode chorus waves and plasma sheet injections) play in modifying these interactions. The proposed study aims to bridge these gaps by combining observational data analysis with theoretical modeling efforts.\nThis enriched background sets a solid foundation for investigating the interactions of EMIC waves with radiation belt electrons and underscores the importance of this research in advancing our understanding of magnetospheric physics and improving our ability to forecast space weather impacts effectively."

    "text": "Discussion and Future Work\nThe findings from this research will deepen our understanding of magnetospheric physics, particularly the role of EMIC waves in electron dynamics. However, several questions are likely to emerge from this study, guiding future research efforts:\n\nWave Source Regions and Propagation: Further investigations may be required to identify the specific source regions of EMIC waves and their propagation characteristics through the magnetosphere. Understanding these aspects could enhance predictions of when and where EMIC waves will impact electron populations.\nInteractions with Other Wave Modes: While this project focuses on EMIC waves, the magnetosphere contains multiple interacting wave modes. Future work could explore the interactions between EMIC waves and other wave types, such as ULF and VLF waves, to provide a more holistic view of the dynamics governing radiation belt electron fluxes.\nTechnological Applications: The development of real-time monitoring tools based on the findings from this research could be explored. These tools would use satellite data to provide immediate assessments of EMIC wave activity and its potential impacts, offering valuable information for satellite operators and space weather forecasters."

Thus explain that starting from M1=1 and moving upwards all M1 values have positive entropy ratios. (iii) Plot the entropy ratio as function of M1 for a range of adiabatic indices.

[FYI: These corrections can become important when the electron inertial response or ion thermal motion become significant, causing an E|| in Ohm’s law, where (-VxB)||=(JxB)||=0\n\nThe current density in the x and y directions are plotted below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJx\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Current density in x and y directions\n\n\n\nThe divergence of the current density is plotted below:\n\n\n\ndivJ\n\n\nWe can see that the divergence of the current density is exactly zero, which means that the current of a moving Alfvén wave pulse closes in the pulse itself.",

    "text": "Problem 3\n\nChen Shi modified his MHD code to accept a moving source of the dBz pulse (source moves in +y). The code is called “moving_source_code.zip” in the lecture notes. Run it and compute the parallel current Jx around this wing at time t=4.0. You will find the current moves towards the source in the upper-right part of the wing and away from the source in the upper-left. This is an apparent current (appearing to connect to the source): each Jx pulse is moving along the field, but contiguous pulses make it appear that the current continues all the way to the source.\n\n\n\n\nJx\n\n\n\n\n\nJy\n\n\nWe can see that current moves towards the source in the upper-right part of the wing with positive \\(J_y\\) and away from the source in the upper-left with negative \\(J_y\\). The current in y direction has the most intensity in the edge of the wing, which let the current close itself.",
