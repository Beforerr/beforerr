    "text": "5. Power series\n\nConsider a power series of the form\n\\[\na=1+ \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} a_n z^n\n\\]\nShow that there is another power series\n\\[\nb = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} b_n z^n\n\\]\nsuch that, as a formal expression\n\\[\nab = 1\n\\]\nDo this by giving a recurrence relation for the coefficients \\(b_n\\). Solve this recurrence relation for \\(1/e^z\\) and show it gives the power series for \\(e^{−z}\\).\n\nThe product \\(ab\\) can be written as:\n\\[\nab = \\left(1 + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} a_n z^n \\right) \\left( \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} b_n z^n \\right) = 1\n\\]\nBy expanding, we get:\n\\[\nab = b_0 + (b_1 + a_1 b_0) z + (b_2 + a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_0) z^2 + \\dots + \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k b_{n-k} \\right) z^n + \\dots\n\\]\nFor \\(ab = 1\\), all the coefficients of \\(z^n\\) (for \\(n \\geq 1\\)) must be zero, and the constant term (the coefficient of \\(z^0\\)) must be 1. This gives us the following conditions:\n\n\\(b_0 = 1\\) (since the constant term of \\(ab\\) must be 1).\nFor \\(n \\geq 1\\), we have \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k b_{n-k} = 0\\).\n\nFor \\(a_k\\), we have \\(a_0 = 1\\) and \\(a_n\\) for \\(n \\geq 1\\). Thus, the recurrence relation for \\(b_n\\) becomes:\n\\[\nb_n = -\\sum_{k=1}^{n} a_k b_{n-k} \\quad \\text{for } n \\geq 1\n\\]\nFor \\(a = e^z\\). The power series for \\(b= 1/e^z\\) is given by:\n\n\\(b_0 = 1\\) (from the initial condition).\nFor \\(n \\geq 1\\):\n\n\\[\nb_n = -\\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{k!} b_{n-k}\n\\]\nAnd if \\(b_n = \\frac{(-1)^n}{n!}\\). Then, it is exactly the power series for \\(e^{-z}\\):\n\\[\ne^{-z} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-z)^n}{n!}\n\\]\nTo prove \\(b_n = \\frac{(-1)^n}{n!}\\), we use induction method. Suppose it is true for \\(n\\), then using\n\\[\n(1 + (-1))^{n+1} = \\sum C_{k}^{n+1}(-1)^{n+1-k} = (n+1)! \\sum_{k=0}^{n+1} \\frac{(-1)^{n+1-k}}{k! (n+1-k)!}\n\\]\nBy substituting \\(b_k = \\frac{(-1)^k}{k!}\\) for \\(k \\le n\\), we have\n\\[\n(-1)^{n+1} / (n+1)~! = -\\sum_{k=1}^{n+1} \\frac{1}{k!} b_{n-k}\n\\]\nSo \\(b_{n+1} = \\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{(n+1)!}\\).

    "text": "6. Expansion near pole\n\nAssuming the result of problem 5 and the bonus problem, show that if \\(f (z) = g(z)/h(z)\\) has a pole at \\(z = 0\\), that we can expand \\(f(z)\\) in a series\n\\[\nf (z) = \\sum_{n=-m}^{\\infty} a_n z^n\n\\]\nfor some \\(m\\), and that this converges in a “punctured disc” \\(\\{ z | |z| &lt; R, z \\ne 0 \\}\\). Make such an expansion for \\(f (z) = z/(1 + z^2)\\) around \\(z = i\\) (hint: for this example we use tricks with geometric series, we don’t need the general recurrence relation).\n\nSince \\(f(z)\\) has a pole at \\(z = 0\\), \\(h(z)\\) must have a zero of order \\(m\\) at \\(z = 0\\)\nGiven this, \\(h(z)\\) can be written as \\(z^m k(z)\\) where \\(k(z)\\) is analytic and non-zero at \\(z = 0\\). Therefore, \\(f(z)\\) can be written as:\n\\[\nf(z) = \\frac{g(z)}{z^m k(z)}\n\\]\nSince \\(k(z)\\) is analytic and non-zero at \\(z = 0\\), there exists a power series \\(\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} b_n z^n\\) such that \\(\\frac{1}{k(z)} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} b_n z^n\\) . This leads to:\n\\[\nf(z) = \\frac{g(z)}{z^m} \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} b_n z^n = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} b_n g(z) z^{n-m}\n\\]\nfor \\(z \\ne 0\\). As \\(g(z)\\) is analytic at \\(z = 0\\), it can also be expanded into a power series around \\(z = 0\\). Thus, the product of these two series results in a series of the form:\n\\[\nf(z) = \\sum_{n=-m}^{\\infty} a_n z^n\n\\]\nThis series converges in some punctured disc \\(\\{ z \\,|\\, |z| &lt; R, z \\ne 0 \\}\\) because it is the product of two convergent power series in that region.\nFor the specific function \\(f(z) = \\frac{z}{1 + z^2}\\), we want to expand around \\(z = i\\)\n\\[\nf(z) = \\frac{z}{(z - i)(z + i)}\n\\]\nTo expand around \\(z = i\\), let’s set \\(w = z - i\\), so \\(z = w + i\\). Then:\n\\[\nf(w + i) = \\frac{w + i}{ w (w + 2i)}\n\\]\nNow, observe that:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{w + 2i} = \\frac{1}{2i} \\cdot \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{w}{2i}}\n\\]\nSince \\(|\\frac{w}{2i}| &lt; 1\\) for \\(|w| &lt; 2\\), we can use the geometric series expansion:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{w}{2i}} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\left(-\\frac{w}{2i}\\right)^n\n\\]\nThus, we get:\n\\[\nf(z) = \\frac{w + i}{2i w } \\cdot \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\left(-\\frac{w}{2i}\\right)^n\n\\]\nwhich will be valid in a punctured disc around \\(z = i\\), specifically for \\(|z - i| &lt; 2\\) (or \\(|w| &lt; 2\\))."

    "text": "If a thin Aluminum layer is deposited over a solid-state detector active area, the energy loss by the particle in that Al layer will not be recorded. The shorter the range of a particle the more the relative energy that will be missed. The range depends on mass near the last portion of the flight: heavier ions stop earlier. Two detectors, a bare one and one with an Al layer, measuring the same beam could give very different results for He+ or O+.\nPlot the energy recorded (past the Al) versus the incident energy, for beams of various energies, and for different thickness (10nm, 100nm, …). Use H+, He+, O+. Demonstrate that with a sufficient number of detectors you could differentiate monoenergetic protons, He+ and O+. Use SPENVIS or GEANT-4 for your modeling.\nBonus: simulate the number of detectors required to deconvolve the effects of a single, thermalized (not beam) distribution with dE/E~100%.\n\nDirections\nThis will be done by creating a plot of energy deposited in Si as function of input energy. You will use freeware Geant-4 which simulates particle interaction with matter, through a portal: SPENVIS. Various models exist there (very useful site!).\nFirst you have to register, then create a project, then input your model input and output parameters, then make a run and get results one-energy-at-a-time. Once you know how to do that, then you must create an array of inputs and outputs outside of SPENVIS in your favorite plotting package (e.g., excel, python or other). You will then record those results and plot them, one array for protons, another for He+ and another for O+. You can try other species as well, for example O2+ which may be present in the low altitude ionosphere.\n\nAssume monoenergetic beams. The program allows you to use a simple ion spectrum. (For the bonus question you have to make a guess on the instrument response function, model it in a simple analytical form, then prove it can be done using Geant-4. You do not have to do the bonus.)\n\nFor your outline, make sure you can obtain results, understand the problem enough to present the requested report structure, before actually doing the plots. Present a statement of task, the process and the expected results to be plotted.\nFor your report, you should not repeat the steps I mention below, but just execute your outline above and go right to the findings, plots and discussion. In the discussion explain how you use the model to design a detector system (how many detectors, thicknesses, orientations etc) that does the job.\n\nOn SPENVIS after registration, name your project and proceed to use Geant-4 “MULASSIS”. You can save your run, and come back to it later.\nYour system will be a 3 layer system, where the first layer is air, the second Al of variable thickness and the third Silicon of a mm or two... enough to stop the highest energy of interest. You shoot some particles (10,000 is a good number), and record how much energy is deposited in Si. Excluding losses in the Si (phonons) the lost energy is mainly due to losses in the Aluminum. Pick the source parameters: How many/which ions, charge angle (-22 deg -&gt; 22 deg).\nFor Geometry you pick the layers above, and for Al choose 0, 1, 10 100 nm, one thickness at a time.\nSpecify the input as monoenergetic beam.\nSpecify analysis parameters as mean energy (the mean energy deposited based on the 10,000 particle run)\nCreate a macro (a bunch of commands that tell Geant-4 what to do) and Run.\nSee the plot\nOutput results (2 numbers) into your program next to input energy to build the in/out energy curve.\nRepeat, one point at a time.\nPlot results for one species and then (in different color) for other species.\nRepeat for different Al thicknesses.\n\n\n\nGeometry Definition\nSource particles\n\nHe+\n\nAtomic number: 2\nNucleon number: 4\n\n\nMaterial Definition\nhttps://www.spenvis.oma.be/restricted/load_result.php/EPSS265/spenvis_mul-rmt.txt\nhttps://www.spenvis.oma.be/spenvis/htusers/b/beforerr/EPSS265/1699989981/spenvis_mlo.txt\n\n\nimport yaml\n\nwith open(\"config.yaml\", 'r') as stream:\n    config = yaml.safe_load(stream)\n\n\nuser = config[\"user\"]\nproject = config[\"project\"]\nrun = config[\"run\"]\nfiles = config[\"files\"]\n\noutput = files[\"output\"]\nreport = files[\"report\"]\n\nbase_url = config[\"base_url\"]\nurl_pattern = config[\"url_pattern\"]\n\nprint(\n    url_pattern.format(\n        base_url=base_url,\n        user=user,\n        project=project,\n        run=run,\n        filename=output[\"filename\"],\n    )\n)\n\nprint(\n    url_pattern.format(\n        base_url=base_url,\n        user=user,\n        project=project,\n        run=run,\n        filename=report[\"filename\"],\n    )\n)\n\nhttps://www.spenvis.oma.be/spenvis/htusers/b//beforerr/EPSS265/1699990533/spenvis_mlo.txt\nhttps://www.spenvis.oma.be/spenvis/htusers/b//beforerr/EPSS265/1699990533/spenvis_mul-rmt.txt\n\n\n\n’*‘, 10, 4, 0, 0, 5, 5, 3, 0 ’DOSE ANALYSIS’ ‘MULASSIS v1.23’ ‘geant4-09-05-patch-02 (22-October-2012)’ ‘File Created: Wed Nov 15 23:11:52 2023’\n‘End of File’\n\n\nSPENVIS generated macrofile for MULASSIS\n/geometry/layer/delete 0 /geometry/material/addNIST G4_Al /geometry/material/addNIST G4_Si /geometry/layer/shape slab /geometry/layer/add 0 Vacuum 1 1.000E+00 mm /geometry/layer/add 1 G4_Al 2 1.000E-03 um /geometry/layer/add 2 G4_Si 3 1.000E+00 mm # Total thickness = 2.000 mm /analysis/file spenvis # # Analysis definition #"

And the data is from 2015-10-16 13:00-14:00UT.\nIts overall summary plot together with SCM quicklook plots are shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMMS Overall Summary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMMS Overall Summary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMMS SCM L2 SURVEY SCSRV\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMMS SCM L2 BRST SCB\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences:\n\nLe Contel, O., P.

The noise equivalent magnetic induction (NEMI or sensitivity) of the search-coil antenna is less than or equal to : 2 pT/sqrt(Hz) at 10 Hz, 0.3 pT/sqrt(Hz) at 100 Hz and 0.05 pT/sqrt(Hz) at 1 kHz (Fig. 6). The SCM resolution at 1k Hz is 0.15pT.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6. Noise curve in magnetic field (” NEMI “) of each axis of the triaxe fluxmeter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\n\nFrom quickplot, we visually find the quiet time is around 2015-10-16T13:06:16. It mathchs expectation and looks quite like the NEMI from publications : resonance near 1kz with minimum noise level, together with a decreasing noise density at low frequencies, and an increasing noise level at high frequencies.\nFrom the quickplot spectrum, we can see there are some waves of 50-200 Hz between 13:06:50 and 13:07:00. Also observed is weak wave near 800 hz before 13:05:40.\n\ndata = get_data(tvar_tdpwrspc[0], xarray=True)\nquiet_time_data = data.sel(time='2015-10-16T13:06:16')\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\nax.loglog(quiet_time_data.spec_bins.data[0], np.sqrt(quiet_time_data.data[0])*1000)\n\nax.set_xlabel(\"Freq (Hz)\")\nax.set_ylabel(\"NEMI (pT/sqrt(Hz))\")\nplt.show()"
