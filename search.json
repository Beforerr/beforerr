Remove the offset from the data.\nWith the spin plane offsets removed, obtain the 3rd component (Z) for times when the Bfield is at a large angle relative to the spin plane (&gt;10 deg or more) using the E*B=0 approximation.\nCompare your estimate of Ez with the measurement of the same component made by the axial electric field boom pair.

    "text": "6. Expansion near pole\n\nAssuming the result of problem 5 and the bonus problem, show that if \\(f (z) = g(z)/h(z)\\) has a pole at \\(z = 0\\), that we can expand \\(f(z)\\) in a series\n\\[\nf (z) = \\sum_{n=-m}^{\\infty} a_n z^n\n\\]\nfor some \\(m\\), and that this converges in a “punctured disc” \\(\\{ z | |z| &lt; R, z \\ne 0 \\}\\). Make such an expansion for \\(f (z) = z/(1 + z^2)\\) around \\(z = i\\) (hint: for this example we use tricks with geometric series, we don’t need the general recurrence relation).\n\nSince \\(f(z)\\) has a pole at \\(z = 0\\), \\(h(z)\\) must have a zero of order \\(m\\) at \\(z = 0\\)\nGiven this, \\(h(z)\\) can be written as \\(z^m k(z)\\) where \\(k(z)\\) is analytic and non-zero at \\(z = 0\\). Therefore, \\(f(z)\\) can be written as:\n\\[\nf(z) = \\frac{g(z)}{z^m k(z)}\n\\]\nSince \\(k(z)\\) is analytic and non-zero at \\(z = 0\\), there exists a power series \\(\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} b_n z^n\\) such that \\(\\frac{1}{k(z)} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} b_n z^n\\) . This leads to:\n\\[\nf(z) = \\frac{g(z)}{z^m} \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} b_n z^n = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} b_n g(z) z^{n-m}\n\\]\nfor \\(z \\ne 0\\). As \\(g(z)\\) is analytic at \\(z = 0\\), it can also be expanded into a power series around \\(z = 0\\). Thus, the product of these two series results in a series of the form:\n\\[\nf(z) = \\sum_{n=-m}^{\\infty} a_n z^n\n\\]\nThis series converges in some punctured disc \\(\\{ z \\,|\\, |z| &lt; R, z \\ne 0 \\}\\) because it is the product of two convergent power series in that region.\nFor the specific function \\(f(z) = \\frac{z}{1 + z^2}\\), we want to expand around \\(z = i\\)\n\\[\nf(z) = \\frac{z}{(z - i)(z + i)}\n\\]\nTo expand around \\(z = i\\), let’s set \\(w = z - i\\), so \\(z = w + i\\). Then:\n\\[\nf(w + i) = \\frac{w + i}{ w (w + 2i)}\n\\]\nNow, observe that:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{w + 2i} = \\frac{1}{2i} \\cdot \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{w}{2i}}\n\\]\nSince \\(|\\frac{w}{2i}| &lt; 1\\) for \\(|w| &lt; 2\\), we can use the geometric series expansion:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{w}{2i}} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\left(-\\frac{w}{2i}\\right)^n\n\\]\nThus, we get:\n\\[\nf(z) = \\frac{w + i}{2i w } \\cdot \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\left(-\\frac{w}{2i}\\right)^n\n\\]\nwhich will be valid in a punctured disc around \\(z = i\\), specifically for \\(|z - i| &lt; 2\\) (or \\(|w| &lt; 2\\)).",

In terms of the Laurent series, this implies that all the coefficients \\(a_n\\) for \\(n &lt; 0\\) are zero because it reduces to its Taylor series.\nConversely, if all \\(a_n = 0\\) for \\(n &lt; 0\\), the Laurent series reduces to a Taylor series, implying that \\(f\\) is holomorphic at \\(z_0\\) (since it can be expressed as a power series), and thus the singularity is removable.\nPole of Order \\(m\\) :\nIf \\(f\\) has a pole of order \\(m\\) at \\(z_0\\), it means that in the Laurent series, there is a term with \\((z - z_0)^{-m}\\) (where \\(a_{-m} \\neq 0\\)) and no terms with higher negative powers.\nConversely, if there is some \\(m &lt; 0\\) such that \\(a_m \\neq 0\\) but \\(a_n = 0\\) for all \\(n &lt; m\\), then the Laurent series has a term \\(a_m (z - z_0)^m\\) as its term with the highest negative power, indicating a pole of order \\(m\\) .\nEssential Singularity:\nIf the singularity at \\(z_0\\) is neither removable nor a pole, it must be an essential singularity. This is characterized by the fact that there are infinitely many negative powers of \\(z - z_0\\) in the Laurent series with non-zero coefficients. In other words, if the Laurent series has non-zero \\(a_n\\) for infinitely many \\(n &lt; 0\\), then \\(z_0\\) is an essential singularity.",

The Hall term is now become comparable to the “v cross B” term with \\(R_3 \\sim 10\\). This term will be more significant when the spatial scale is smaller (for example, near the reconnection region).\nThe ratio of the electron inertia to the Hall term is given by\n\\[\nR_4/R_3 = \\frac{L * B}{V} * \\frac{e}{m_e}\n\\]\nSince \\(R_4\\) is proportional to \\(L^2\\), and \\(R_3\\) is proportional to \\(L\\), the ratio \\(R_4/R_3\\) is proportional to \\(L\\).

    "text": "2 Gravitational Frequency Shift\nSuppose you are standing in your “laboratory,” a steel box of height l. The laboratory is sitting on the Earth, so you and everything in it feel a downward gravitational acceleration of magnitude \\(g = 10 m s^{−2}\\) (don’t use the numerical value in this problem, just call it g).\n\nIf you drop a ball from rest at the top of the box, it hits the bottom after a time \\(t\\), where \\(g t^2/2 = l\\). Show that its kinetic energy at the bottom of the box is \\(E_b = m l g\\).\nYour friend is in a similar laboratory in space, far enough away from the Earth that its gravity is negligible. She has attached a laser to the ceiling of her laboratory, pointing down towards a light detector on the floor. The laser emits photons that have frequency νt. The detector at the bottom can measure the frequency (and hence the color) of photons that it receives. If the laboratory were floating freely in space, then the frequency of the photons received at the bottom would be νb = νt. How long does it take photons to go from the top of the box to the bottom? (Give an equation for the time tb in terms of l and c.)\n\nNow suppose that your friend’s laboratory is not floating freely but is being towed by a rocket that is accelerating upwards (in the frame of your friend) with acceleration a = 10 m s−2. By the time the light reaches the bottom, therefore, the box is moving upwards with a speed vbox = at. What is the frequency νb of photons measured by a detector bolted to the floor at the bottom of the box? (Give a formula expressing \\(ν_b\\) in terms of νt, a, l, and c.) Are the photons at the bottom bluer or redder than those emitted at the top? Hint: You can assume that the travel time is the same as in (b) so long as \\(v_{box}&lt;&lt;c\\).\n\nRemember that the energy of a photon with frequency ν is E = hν. Show that the photons received at the bottom of the box have greater energy than those emitted at the top of the box by an amount ≈ Et × (al/c2).\n\nYou install an identical laser and light detector in your laboratory on the earth. The laser again emits photons with frequency νt. Apply the equivalence principle discussed in class to answer the following questions: (i) Are the photons received at the bottom bluer, redder, or the same color as those emitted at the top? (ii) Do photons gain energy, lose energy, or keep the same energy as they fall through the box? (iii) What is the amount of energy that a photon gains or loses as it falls through the box? (If the energy doesn’t change, answer zero.) Explain (briefly) the reasoning behind your answers.\nCompare your answers to part (e) and part (a). What does this comparison suggest?\n\n\n\n2.1 Kinetic Energy\n\\[\nl = \\frac{1}{2}gt^2\n\\implies\nt = \\sqrt{\\frac{2l}{g}}\n\\]\n\\[\nv = gt = g \\sqrt{\\frac{2l}{g}} = \\sqrt{2gl}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\implies\nE_b = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \\frac{1}{2}m(2gl) = m g l\n\\]\n\n\n\n2.2 Traverse Time\n\\[\nt_b = \\frac{l}{c}\n\\]\n\n\n\n2.3 Frequency Shift\n\\[\n\\nu_b = \\nu_t \\left(1 + \\frac{v_{\\text{box}}}{c}\\right)\n\\]\nAssume that the travel time is the same\n\\[\nv_{\\text{box}} = at = a \\left(\\frac{l}{c}\\right)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\implies\n\\nu_b = \\nu_t \\left(1 + \\frac{a l}{c^2}\\right)\n\\]\nThe photons received at the bottom are bluer than those emitted at the top.\n\n\n\n2.4 Energy Difference\n\\[\nE_b = h\\nu_b = h\\nu_t \\left(1 + \\frac{a l}{c^2}\\right) = E_t \\left(1 + \\frac{a l}{c^2}\\right)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\implies\n\\Delta E = E_b - E_t = E_t \\left(\\frac{a l}{c^2}\\right)\n\\]\n\n\n\n2.5 Equivalence Principle\nAccording to the equivalence principle, being in a gravitational field is equivalent to being in an accelerated frame. Thus, photons climbing down a gravitational well gain energy, appearing bluer at the bottom.\n\\[\n\\Delta E \\approx E_t \\left(\\frac{g l}{c^2}\\right)\n\\]\n\n\n\n2.6 Comparison Between Parts (a) and (e)\nkinetic energy gained by the ball is \\(E_b = mgl\\)\nphotons gain energy \\(\\Delta E \\approx E_t \\left(\\frac{g l}{c^2}\\right)\\)\nImplications: The energy gained by both the ball and the photons is proportional to \\(g l\\), suggests that gravitational effects are universally applicable. Also consider if the energy gained is equivalent for both the ball and the photons \\(E_b = \\Delta E\\), this implies that \\(m = E_t/c^2\\), similar to the mass-energy equivalence.",

    "text": "3 Voyager 2 Heliospheric termination shock\n\nVoyager 2 crossed the Heliospheric termination shock and entered the heliosheath in Aug. 2007.\n\n\n3.1 Plot and analysis\n\n[a] Plot the shock crossing in CDAWeb using their own plotting resources. In particular plot the total and RTN components of the magnetic field, flow speed, proton density N, and temperature T. In a short paragraph explain: what is the RTN system and how did you create the plot? In a second paragraph explain if the changes in the above parameters are consistent with shock crossings.\n\nThe RTN (Radial-Tangential-Normal) coordinate system is a heliocentric coordinate system used to describe the position in relation to the Sun fixed at a spacecraft (or the planet): The R axis is directed radially away from the Sun, the T axis is the cross product of the solar rotation axis and the R axis, and the N axis is the cross product of R and T.\n\nWe utilize the combined COHOWeb dataset (VOYAGER2_COHO1HR_MERGED_MAG_PLASMA, https://cdaweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/misc/NotesV.html#VOYAGER2_COHO1HR_MERGED_MAG_PLASMA) (Ness et al. 2023). The plot was generated using “CDAWeb Data Explorer” by selecting the “Plot Data” option and choosing the appropriate data variable. We select time range from 2007/08/01 00:00:00.000 to 2007/09/30 00:00:00.000.\nAround the end of August 31, we observe a significant decrease in bulk flow velocity accompanied by increases in proton density and temperature, corresponding to the shock crossing. Additionally, the magnetic field exhibits a slight increase. These changes are consistent with shock crossings, as shocks typically cause reductions in downstream flow velocity and simultaneous enhancements in plasma density, temperature, and magnetic field strength.\n\n[b] What is the change in pressure, including dynamic pressure, across the shock (assume the crossing is along the shock normal)? To do this also ignore the electron thermal pressure (just use ion thermal pressure) and plot the quantity: N*V^2 + Pt, where Pt is the sum of magnetic and thermal pressures. Do this using your own tools (not SPEDAS) after downloading the data from SPDF.\n\n\n\nCode\nusing Unitful\nusing Unitful: μ0, k, mp\n\nregister(DataDep(\"VOYAGER2_COHO1HR_MERGED_MAG_PLASMA\",\n    \"\"\"\n    Dataset: VOYAGER2_COHO1HR_MERGED_MAG_PLASMA\n    Website: https://cdaweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/misc/NotesV.html#VOYAGER2_COHO1HR_MERGED_MAG_PLASMA\n    \"\"\",\n    \"https://cdaweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/tmp/cweb_B6vad1PhkF/VOYAGER2_COHO1HR_MERGED_MAG_PLASMA_1663093.csv\"\n))\n\n# Read the CSV file\nVIM_file = readdir(datadep\"VOYAGER2_COHO1HR_MERGED_MAG_PLASMA\", join=true)[1]\ndata = CSV.File(VIM_file; comment=\"#\") |&gt; DataFrame\n\nallowmissing!(data)\ndata[!, \"time\"] = DateTime.(data.\"EPOCH_yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.sssZ\", \"yyyy-mm-ddTHH:MM:SS.sssZ\")\nfor c ∈ eachcol(data)\n    replace!(c, -1.0e31 =&gt; missing)\nend\ndropmissing!(data)\n\nN = data[!, \"SW_PROTON_DENS_n/cc\"] * u\"cm^-3\"\nV = data[!, \"BULK_FLOW_SPEED_km/s\"] * u\"km/s\"\nB = data[!, \"FIELD_MAGNITUDE_AVG._nT\"] * u\"nT\"\nT = data[!, \"RADIAL_PROTON_TEMP_deg_k\"] * u\"K\"\n\n# Calculate the pressure\npB = B .^ 2 / μ0 / 2 ./ 1u\"nPa\" .|&gt; NoUnits\npT = k * N .* T ./ u\"nPa\" .|&gt; NoUnits\npRam = mp * N .* V .^ 2 ./ u\"nPa\" .|&gt; NoUnits\npressure = pRam .+ pB .+ pT\nbeta = pT ./ pB\ntime = data.\"time\"\n\n# Plot the data\nfig = Figure()\nax = Axis(fig[1, 1], title=\"Pressure Across Shock\", xlabel=\"Time\", ylabel=\"Pressure (nPa)\")\nlines!(time, pRam, color=:blue, label=\"Ram Pressure\")\nlines!(time, pB, color=:green, label=\"Magnetic Pressure\")\nlines!(time, pT, color=:red, label=\"Thermal Pressure\")\nlines!(time, pressure, color=:black, label=\"Total Pressure\")\naxislegend(ax)\n\nax2 = Axis(fig[2, 1], xlabel=\"Time\", ylabel=\"Beta\")\nlines!(time, beta)\n\nhidexdecorations!(ax, grid=false)\nfig\n\n\n┌ Warning: Over-writing registration of the datadep\n│   name = \"VOYAGER2_COHO1HR_MERGED_MAG_PLASMA\"\n└ @ DataDeps ~/.julia/packages/DataDeps/Y2lje/src/registration.jl:15",

    "text": "1 Introduction\nIn this report, I will demonstrate the application of Julia in space data analysis. Due to its highly flexible type system, multiple dispatch feature, and seamless interoperability between Python and C packages, Julia enables the implementation of SPEDAS complex functionalities in a concise and generalizable manner, often requiring only a few lines of code.\nMore specifically, we utilize\n\nDimensionalData : which provides an abstract array with named dimensions, facilitating more intuitive indexing and generalized manipulation.\nUnitful : which enables seamless unit conversion and supports dimensional analysis\n\nSince Julia features an abstract type system, most packages can be used directly and composed seamlessly without unintended side effects. This contrasts with Python, where inheritance and subtyping are commonly used, making it more challenging to share functionality across different classes.\ndegap and rectify_datetime are used to clean up the data and rectify the time series (make timestamps uniform).\nfunction degap(da::DimArray; dim=Ti)\n    dims = otherdims(da, dim)\n    rows = filter(x -&gt; !any(isnan, x), eachslice(da; dims))\n    if !isempty(rows)\n        cat(rows...; dims)\n    else\n        similar(da, (0, size(da, 2)))\n    end\nend\n\nfunction degap(ts::TimeArray)\n    ts[all.(!isnan, eachrow(values(ts)))]\nend\n\nfunction rectify_datetime(da; tol=2, kwargs...)\n    times = dims(da, Ti)\n    t0 = times[1]\n    dtime = Quantity.(times.val .- t0)\n    new_times = TimeseriesTools.rectify(Ti(dtime); tol)[1]\n    set(da, Ti =&gt; new_times .+ t0)\nend\ntplot could be decomposed into multiple steps and lead to better readability and flexibility.\n\"\"\"\nLay out multiple time series on the same figure across different panels (rows)\n\"\"\"\nfunction tplot(f, tas::AbstractVector; add_legend=true, link_xaxes=true, kwargs...)\n    aps = map(enumerate(tas)) do (i, ta)\n        ap = tplot(f[i, 1], ta; kwargs...)\n        # Hide redundant x labels\n        link_xaxes && i != length(tas) && hidexdecorations!(ap.axis, grid=false)\n        ap\n    end\n    axs = map(ap -&gt; ap.axis, aps)\n    link_xaxes && linkxaxes!(axs...)\n    add_legend && axislegend.(axs)\n    FigureAxes(f, axs)\nend\n\n\"\"\"\nSetup the axis on a position and plot multiple time series on it\n\"\"\"\nfunction tplot(gp::GridPosition, tas::AbstractVector; kwargs...)\n    ax = Axis(gp, ylabel=ylabel(ta))\n    plots = map(tas) do ta\n        tplot!(ax, ta; kwargs...)\n    end\n    ax, plots\nend\n\n\"\"\"\nPlot a multivariate time series on a position in a figure\n\"\"\"\nfunction tplot(gp::GridPosition, ta::AbstractDimArray; labeldim=nothing, kwargs...)\n    args, attributes = _series(ta, kwargs, labeldim)\n    series(gp, args...; attributes...)\nend\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nSome functions in this report have been collected into multiple Julia packages Speasy.jl and SpaceTools.jl, please refer to the package for more information.",

    "text": "2 Energy input and energy dissipation\n\nCompute the total energy input and total energy dissipation in the magnetosphere during a storm, the one which occurred on 17 March, 2015. This was the largest storm of the previous solar cycle. The total energy input rate is: \\(ε[W]= (4π/μ_0)V B^2 \\sin^4(θ/2) I_0^2\\), also widely known as the Akasofu “epsilon” parameter1,2,3,4,5,6, with \\(θ = acos(B_{z,GSM}/B_{yz,GSM})\\), \\(I_0 =7RE\\). Its cumulative integral is: \\(U_{in}= ∫εdt\\) [in PetaJoules]. The magnetospheric energy dissipation rate in the ionosphere and ring current (in J/s or W) is: \\(W_{md}=[4 10^{13}(∂(-Dst*)/∂t + (-Dst*)/τ_R)+300 AE]\\) and its integral is given by: \\(U_{md}=∫ W_{md} dt\\) [in PJ], where: \\(τ_R=1\\) hr is the ring-current decay rate of O+ through charge exchange in the beginning of the storm, and \\(τ_R=6\\) hr late in the storm recovery when H+ is the dominant species, and Dst* is the corrected Dst to account for SW pressure variations6.

    "text": "4 The Magnetorotational Instability\nAccretion disks typically exhibit differential rotation. So as the disk rotates, fluid elements become more azimuthally separated. Magnetic tension oppose such separation, however, such force acts to decrease the angular momentum of the inner fluid element and increase that of the outer element. Because angular momentum is an increasing function of radius in Keplerian disks, this transfer of angular momentum causes the fluid elements to separate further radially, leading to instability. This continuously growing stretching and twisting of magnetic field lines generate MHD turbulence. The turbulent motions effectively act as a efficient “viscous” force, facilitating the transfer of angular momentum.",

    "text": "2 Binary Evolution\nAs a star transfers mass to a nearby compact object, the mass ratio of the system changes, and hence the dynamics will evolve. Here you will examine how this evolution occurs in a low-mass X-ray binary. Let us consider two stars of masses m1 and m2 on circular orbits in a system in which the center of mass is the origin.\n\nA very simple approximation to the Roche lobe radius of star 1, \\(R_{L,1}\\) is\n\n\\[\nR_{L, 1} \\sim \\frac{a}{2}\\left(\\frac{m_1}{m_{\\mathrm{tot}}}\\right)^{1 / 3}\n\\]\nwhere \\(q=M_1 / M_2\\).

Show that this requires \\(q\\le1.3\\). (With the true form of \\(R_L(q)\\), the threshold is slightly smaller.) We thus generally find that the donor star is less massive than the accreting object in X-ray binaries! This is believed to be why there are so few intermediate mass X-ray binaries: mass transfer proceeds very rapidly until the donor star is less massive than the compact object. Hint: Note that \\(∆R_{L,1} &lt; 0\\) if \\(∆m_2 &gt; 0\\); this will affect how to interpret the absolute value signs.",

    "text": "3 Black Hole Mergers\n\nIn the last decade – after many decades of hard work! – physicists have detected gravitational waves from merging stellar mass black holes. These have been quite different from the sources we expected and have raised many questions about stellar mass black holes. Read this article: https://www.quantamagazine.org/colliding-black-holes-tell-new-story-ofstars-20160906/\nSummarize the models for the formation of these systems, and weigh the evidence to determine what you think is the most likely option. (There’s no right answer, though you can find more recent discussions on the internet if you want to see what has been learned since!)\n\n\nCommon-Envelope Evolution (Classic Theory):\n\n\nFormation: A pair of massive stars begins in a wide orbit.\nBlack Hole Formation: Star A collapses into a black hole while Star B grows, further shrinking the orbit. When Star B exhausts its fuel, it also collapses into a black hole. The two black holes, now close, eventually spiral into each other and merge.\nKey Features: This process involves complex interactions with hydrogen envelopes and gas loss, which draw the stars closer.\n\n\nChemically Homogeneous Evolution (New Theory):\n\n\nFormation: Two massive stars in a tight orbit are “tidally locked”. Their rapid spinning stirs the stars, maintaining uniform chemical composition and high internal heat.\nBlack Hole Formation: Unlike most stars, which have distinct core and envelope layers, these stars fuse entirely and contract into compact black holes without shedding much material. The black holes are already close, and their merger happens as they spiral closer due to gravitational waves.\nKey Features: This model skips the envelope phase and results in direct black hole formation in a tight orbit.\n\nThe Chemically Homogeneous Evolution model seems most plausible for explaining the unexpected large masses of black holes in recent mergers. However, the Common-Envelope Evolution might still account for a broader range of scenarios. Future data could favor one model definitively, or they might work in tandem to explain different types of mergers.",

We then expand \\(f(t)\\) around this point:\n\\[\nf(t) \\approx f(n) + \\frac{1}{2} f''(n) (t - n)^2\n\\]\nwhere \\(f(n) = \\log n - 1\\) and \\(f''(n) = -1/n^2\\). The integral becomes:\n\\[\n\\Gamma(n+1) \\approx e^{n \\log n - n} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{(t-n)^2}{n}} dt\n\\]\nChanging variables with \\(u = \\frac{t-n}{\\sqrt{n}}\\) gives:\n\\[\n\\Gamma(n+1) \\approx e^{n \\log n - n} \\sqrt{n} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-\\frac{1}{2} u^2} du\n\\]\nRecognizing the Gaussian integral, we get:\n\\[\n\\Gamma(n+1) = n! \\approx e^{n \\log n - n} \\sqrt{2 \\pi n} = \\sqrt{2 \\pi n} n^n e^{-n} \\quad n \\rightarrow \\infty\n\\]\nThe second derivative \\(f''(t)\\) at the point \\(t = n\\) gives us the next leading term. The third derivative of \\(f(t)\\) is:\n\\[\nf'''(t) = \\frac{2}{t^3}\n\\]\nEvaluating this at \\(t = n\\) gives:\n\\[\nf'''(n) = \\frac{2}{n^3}\n\\]\nThe corresponding term in the expansion is of the order \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\), which leads to the next term in the series being \\(\\frac{1}{12n}\\). Therefore, the improved Stirling’s formula, including the next term in the asymptotic series, is:\n\\[\nn! \\sim \\sqrt{2 \\pi n}\\, n^n e^{-n} \\left( 1 + \\frac{1}{12n} \\right)\n\\]",

Compute this by residues and take the limit \\(N \\rightarrow \\infty\\) to show it equals \\(\\vartheta_3(\\tau)\\).

The residue at each pole \\(n\\) (an integer) is given by evaluating the limit as \\(z \\to n\\) of \\((z - n)\\) times the integrand. This leads to residues of the form \\(e^{-\\pi i n^2 \\tau}\\).\nSumming the residues for all poles within the contour, we get:\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=-N}^N e^{-\\pi i n^2 \\tau}\n\\]\nThis is a finite sum approximation of the theta function \\(\\vartheta_3(\\tau)\\).\nAs \\(N \\to \\infty\\), this sum becomes \\(\\vartheta_3(\\tau)\\). So, we have:\n\\[\n\\lim_{N \\to \\infty} I_N(\\tau) = \\vartheta_3(\\tau)\n\\]\nThe contour integral can be rewritten as:\n\\[\n\\vartheta_3(\\tau) = \\int_{-\\infty-i\\epsilon}^{\\infty-i\\epsilon} \\frac{e^{-\\pi i z^2 \\tau}}{e^{2 \\pi i z} - 1} dz - \\int_{-\\infty+i\\epsilon}^{\\infty+i\\epsilon} \\frac{e^{-\\pi i z^2 \\tau}}{e^{2 \\pi i z} - 1} dz\n\\]\nHere, \\(\\epsilon\\) is a small positive number. The integrand can be expanded using the geometric series for \\(e^{2 \\pi i z}\\). This series converges absolutely for \\(|\\text{Im}(z)| &gt; 0\\).\nAfter the series expansion, the integrals involve terms of the form \\(e^{-\\pi i z^2 \\tau}\\) which are Gaussian integrals. These integrals can be evaluated directly, and due to the symmetry of the Gaussian, they will involve a factor of \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{i \\tau}}\\).\nBy summing these integrals, we obtain the identity:\n\\[\n\\vartheta_3(\\tau) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{i \\tau}} \\vartheta_3\\left(-\\frac{1}{\\tau}\\right)\n\\]",

Use SPENVIS or GEANT-4 for your modeling.\n\nThe energy loss of particles depends on the nature of particles (mass, charge, etc), the incident energy, and the thickness of the Al layer.\nFor the two-layer detector, where the ﬁrst layer is Al and the second layer is Silicon, the thickness of the Al layer varies from 0 nm to 100 nm with the thickness of the Si layer ﬁxed to 2 mm.\nAs shown in Figure 1, heavier ions like O+ deposits more energy in the Al layer than lighter ions like He+ and H+, leading to a smaller energy recorded by the Si layer.\nAnd for O+ with low incoming energy below a certain energy threshold \\(E\\), the recorded deposited energy in Si layer will drop to zero. This threshold energy \\(E\\) depends on the thickness of the Al layer \\(d\\). The thicker the Al layer, the higher the threshold energy.\n\\[E=E(d)\\]\nMore generally, the threshold energy \\(E\\) also depends the incident particle \\(s\\).\n\\[E=E(d,s)\\]\n\n\nCode\nusing Pkg\nPkg.add([\n    \"YAML\",\n    \"DataFrames\",\n    \"Gadfly\",\n    \"Unitful\",\n])\n\nusing YAML\nusing DataFrames\nusing Gadfly\nusing Unitful\n\n\n\n\nCode\nfunction parse_result_line(line)\n    values = split(line, ',')\n    Layer = parse(Int, values[1])\n    Thickness = parse(Float64, values[2])  # Assuming thickness in cm\n    Density = parse(Float64, values[3])    # Assuming density in g/cm3\n    Dose = parse(Float64, values[4])       # Assuming dose in keV\n    Error = try\n        parse(Float64, values[5])\n    catch _\n        NaN\n    end  # Handle '-nan' and other errors\n\n    return (Layer, Thickness, Density, Dose, Error)\nend\n\nfunction convert_data(yaml_data)\n    # Iterate through the data and convert each field\n    for entry in yaml_data\n        entry[\"layer.Al.thickness\"] = parse(Float64, replace(entry[\"layer.Al.thickness\"], \" um\" =&gt; \"\")) * 1000 * u\"nm\"\n        entry[\"source\"][\"energy\"] = parse(Float64, replace(entry[\"source\"][\"energy\"], \" MeV\" =&gt; \"\")) * 1000\n        entry[\"result\"] = [parse_result_line(line) for line in split(entry[\"result\"], '\\n') if line != \"\"]\n    end\n\n    df = DataFrame(\n        IncidentEnergy=[entry[\"source\"][\"energy\"] for entry in yaml_data],\n        DepositedEnergy=[entry[\"result\"][3][4] for entry in yaml_data],\n        SourceParticle=[entry[\"source\"][\"particle\"] for entry in yaml_data],\n        LayerAlThickness=[entry[\"layer.Al.thickness\"] for entry in yaml_data],\n    )\n\n    return df\nend\n\n\nconvert_data (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nfunction read_data(filename=\"result.yml\")\n    # Read YAML file or string\n    filepath = joinpath(@__DIR__, \"run\", filename)\n    # Parse YAML content\n    parsed_data = YAML.load_file(filepath)\n\n    # Convert data to DataFrame\n    df = convert_data(parsed_data)\n\n    return df\nend\n\n\nread_data (generic function with 2 methods)\n\n\nThe result from SPENVIS is stored in a yaml file.

    "text": "Differentiate monoenergetic ions\n\nDemonstrate that with a sufficient number of detectors you could differentiate monoenergetic protons, He+ and O+.\n\nAssuming the Protons constitute \\(n_1\\) percen, He+ \\(n_2\\), and O+ \\(n_3\\) of the incoming beam. For three unknown variables \\(n_1\\), \\(n_2\\), \\(n_3\\), we need at least three detectors to solve the equation system. With the first detector recording the total incoming energy \\(E_1\\), the second detector \\(E_2\\), and the third detector \\(E_3\\), we have the following equation system:\n\\[E_1 = n_1 E + n_2 E + n_3 E\\]\n\\[E_2 = n_1 \\alpha_{2,p} E + n_2 \\alpha_{2,He+} E + n_3 \\alpha_{2,O+} E\\]\n\\[E_3 = n_1 \\alpha_{3,p} E + n_2 \\alpha_{3,He+} E + n_3 \\alpha_{3,O+} E\\]\nwhere \\(\\alpha_{2,p}\\), \\(\\alpha_{2,He+}\\), \\(\\alpha_{2,O+}\\), \\(\\alpha_{3,p}\\), \\(\\alpha_{3,He+}\\), \\(\\alpha_{3,O+}\\) are 1- the energy loss ratio of protons, He+ and O+ in the Al layer of the second and third detector respectively.\nSince \\(\\alpha_{i,p}\\) can be determined from experiment/simulation, we can solve the above equation to get \\(n_1\\), \\(n_2\\), \\(n_3\\).\nIf we want to well differentiate monoenergetic protons, He+ and O+ with energy \\(E\\), we can reverse the relationship \\(E=E(d,s)\\) to get the thickness of the Al layer \\(d\\) for each ion. This is possible because theoretically the threshold energy \\(E\\) is a monotonic increasing function of the thickness of the Al layer \\(d\\).\n\\[d=d(E,s)\\]\nSo for a detector with a thickness \\(d_{O+}=d(E,O+)\\) of the Al layer, we only detect the deposited energy of protons and He+ in the Si layer. And for a detector with a thickness \\(d_{He+}=d(E,He+)\\) of the Al layer, we only detect the deposited energy of protons in the Si layer.\nThen we have additional \\(\\alpha_{2,O+}=0\\) and \\(\\alpha_{3,O+}=\\alpha_{3,He+}=0\\) in the equation system, simplifying the equation system to:\n\\[E_1 = n_1 E + n_2 E + n_3 E\\]\n\\[E_2 = n_1 \\alpha_{2,p} E + n_2 \\alpha_{2,He+} E\\]\n\\[E_3 = n_1 \\alpha_{3,p} E\\]\nTo demonstrate the differentiation, suppose the energy of the incoming beam is \\(E=100\\) keV.\nFrom the Figure 2, we can use the following thickness of the Al layer to differentiate the three ions:\n\n\\(d_{1} = d_{O+} \\approx 300 nm\\)\n\\(d_{2} = d_{He+} \\approx 610 nm\\)\n\nAnd we have \\(\\alpha_{2,p} \\approx 0.59\\), \\(\\alpha_{2,He+} \\approx 0.38\\) and \\(\\alpha_{3,p} \\approx 0.22\\) from the simulation. The equation is solvable.\n\n\nCode\ndf2 = read_data(\"result_2.yml\")\n\n\n15×4

You will use freeware Geant-4 which simulates particle interaction with matter, through a portal: SPENVIS. Various models exist there (very useful site!).\nFirst you have to register, then create a project, then input your model input and output parameters, then make a run and get results one-energy-at-a-time. Once you know how to do that, then you must create an array of inputs and outputs outside of SPENVIS in your favorite plotting package (e.g., excel, python or other). You will then record those results and plot them, one array for protons, another for He+ and another for O+. You can try other species as well, for example O2+ which may be present in the low altitude ionosphere.\n\nAssume monoenergetic beams. The program allows you to use a simple ion spectrum. (For the bonus question you have to make a guess on the instrument response function, model it in a simple analytical form, then prove it can be done using Geant-4. You do not have to do the bonus.)\n\nFor your report, you should not repeat the steps I mention below, but just execute your outline above and go right to the findings, plots and discussion. In the discussion explain how you use the model to design a detector system (how many detectors, thicknesses, orientations etc) that does the job.\n\nOn SPENVIS after registration, name your project and proceed to use Geant-4 “MULASSIS”. You can save your run, and come back to it later.\nYour system will be a 3 layer system, where the first layer is air, the second Al of variable thickness and the third Silicon of a mm or two... enough to stop the highest energy of interest. You shoot some particles (10,000 is a good number), and record how much energy is deposited in Si. Excluding losses in the Si (phonons) the lost energy is mainly due to losses in the Aluminum. Pick the source parameters: How many/which ions, charge angle (-22 deg -&gt; 22 deg).\nFor Geometry you pick the layers above, and for Al choose 0, 1, 10 100 nm, one thickness at a time.\nSpecify the input as monoenergetic beam.\nSpecify analysis parameters as mean energy (the mean energy deposited based on the 10,000 particle run)\nCreate a macro (a bunch of commands that tell Geant-4 what to do) and Run.\nSee the plot\nOutput results (2 numbers) into your program next to input energy to build the in/out energy curve.\nRepeat, one point at a time.\nPlot results for one species and then (in different color) for other species.\nRepeat for different Al thicknesses.",

    "text": "Question 2\n\nFor a day/time of interestNote1 from THEMIS or MMS, based on your perusal of the overview plots at the mission website, and using standard tools:\n\nPlot SCM time-series data in 2 different coordinate systems: one that you introduce from L2 files and one you create by rotating the data using cotrans (e.g., GSE and SM coord’s).\nDo a time-series spectrogram of a SCM component in some geophysical coordinates in survey and burst mode up to a high frequency, several kHz (use waveburst from THEMIS or “hb” from MMS).\nSelect a time when the geophysical signal (plasma waves) is at minimum (a quiet period) by looking at the dynamic power spectrum first. Compare the quiet time spectrum (a line spectrum) plot with published instrument noise curves: Point out the characteristic noise curve, a decreasing noise density as a function of frequency at low frequencies, a minimum near the resonance, and an increasing noise level at high frequencies – does it match expectation? Can you point out the plasma waves in the dynamic power spectrum?\n\nNote1: A good day for THEMIS is the first results Space Sci. Rev. paper (2007-03-23 13-16UT,) or the first Science paper (2008-02-26 4- 6UT) from any THEMIS spacecraft.

The noise equivalent magnetic induction (NEMI or sensitivity) of the search-coil antenna is less than or equal to : 2 pT/sqrt(Hz) at 10 Hz, 0.3 pT/sqrt(Hz) at 100 Hz and 0.05 pT/sqrt(Hz) at 1 kHz (Fig. 6).

It mathchs expectation and looks quite like the NEMI from publications : resonance near 1kz with minimum noise level, together with a decreasing noise density at low frequencies, and an increasing noise level at high frequencies.\nFrom the quickplot spectrum, we can see there are some waves of 50-200 Hz between 13:06:50 and 13:07:00. Also observed is weak wave near 800 hz before 13:05:40.\n\n\nCode\ndata = get_data(tvar_tdpwrspc[0], xarray=True)\nquiet_time_data = data.sel(time='2015-10-16T13:06:16')\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\nax.loglog(quiet_time_data.spec_bins.data[0], np.sqrt(quiet_time_data.data[0])*1000)\n\nax.set_xlabel(\"Freq (Hz)\")\nax.set_ylabel(\"NEMI (pT/sqrt(Hz))\")\nplt.show()",
