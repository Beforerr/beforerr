Compare the quiet time spectrum (a line spectrum) plot with published instrument noise curves: Point out the characteristic noise curve, a decreasing noise density as a function of frequency at low frequencies, a minimum near the resonance, and an increasing noise level at high frequencies – does it match expectation? Can you point out the plasma waves in the dynamic power spectrum?\n\nNote1: A good day for THEMIS is the first results Space Sci.

The noise equivalent magnetic induction (NEMI or sensitivity) of the search-coil antenna is less than or equal to : 2 pT/sqrt(Hz) at 10 Hz, 0.3 pT/sqrt(Hz) at 100 Hz and 0.05 pT/sqrt(Hz) at 1 kHz (Fig. 6). The SCM resolution at 1k Hz is 0.15pT.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.

It mathchs expectation and looks quite like the NEMI from publications : resonance near 1kz with minimum noise level, together with a decreasing noise density at low frequencies, and an increasing noise level at high frequencies.\nFrom the quickplot spectrum, we can see there are some waves of 50-200 Hz between 13:06:50 and 13:07:00. Also observed is weak wave near 800 hz before 13:05:40.\n\n\nCode\ndata = get_data(tvar_tdpwrspc[0], xarray=True)\nquiet_time_data = data.sel(time='2015-10-16T13:06:16')\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\nax.loglog(quiet_time_data.spec_bins.data[0], np.sqrt(quiet_time_data.data[0])*1000)\n\nax.set_xlabel(\"Freq (Hz)\")\nax.set_ylabel(\"NEMI (pT/sqrt(Hz))\")\nplt.show()",

Can you tell where the anisotropy reverses from towards to away from the RX region?

    "text": "Notes\nI have released a cribsheet “myexample_FPI_mom_part_spectra” for doing moments and enegry/angle spectra calculations using pyspedas. The crib sheet (.pyspd) and its Jupytr notebook (.ipynb) along with 2 plots they produce are in mms_BE_FPI_pyspd_cribs.zip. They show you how to make moments, and energy, phi, theta, pitch angle and gyrophase spectrograms for ions and electrons from MMS L2 data.\nNote that energy spectra and moments already exist as L2 products. The routines I mention create additional angle spectrograms that are useful for analysis.\nThere are some problems with mms_part_getspec, the basic routine for doing the above spectra. (I have informed the software team and they will resolve these problems soon enough.) The major bugs are:\n\nThe ion moments computation does not produce good results (plotted in the second figure, and compared to L2 moments you can simply load and plot in the first figure) so you cannot yet trust them. The symptom is that the computed ion density is too high and the ion velocity compared to the directly-loaded ion moments. This may be simply an issue of setting the right keywords in the computation and making them default or at least documenting them. Electron moments seem fine.\nThe pitch-angle spectrogram computation for ions or electrons does not produce anything. I have commented out the calls producing them.\n\nThe crib sheet only applies the above moments and spectrogram calc’s to 5 minutes of fast survey data. Some take several minutes to complete but some take less than 1 minute. Some are un-necessarily long and I have informed the team on methods to accelerate them. For now, you can see them run one at a time and can plot the results, and digest them, while another one is running in the background.\nThese are similar to routines that already exist in IDL for both THEMIS and MMS, but in PySPEDAS only the MMS ones are currently available. The tools are generic enough and will be implemented on THEMIS and other spacecraft in the future.",

Use SPENVIS or GEANT-4 for your modeling.\n\nThe energy loss of particles depends on the nature of particles (mass, charge, etc), the incident energy, and the thickness of the Al layer.\nFor the two-layer detector, where the ﬁrst layer is Al and the second layer is Silicon, the thickness of the Al layer varies from 0 nm to 100 nm with the thickness of the Si layer ﬁxed to 2 mm.\nAs shown in Figure 1, heavier ions like O+ deposits more energy in the Al layer than lighter ions like He+ and H+, leading to a smaller energy recorded by the Si layer.\nAnd for O+ with low incoming energy below a certain energy threshold \\(E\\), the recorded deposited energy in Si layer will drop to zero.

The power series for \\(b= 1/e^z\\) is given by:\n\n\\(b_0 = 1\\) (from the initial condition).\nFor \\(n \\geq 1\\):\n\n\\[\nb_n = -\\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{k!} b_{n-k}\n\\]\nAnd if \\(b_n = \\frac{(-1)^n}{n!}\\). Then, it is exactly the power series for \\(e^{-z}\\):\n\\[\ne^{-z} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-z)^n}{n!}\n\\]\nTo prove \\(b_n = \\frac{(-1)^n}{n!}\\), we use induction method. Suppose it is true for \\(n\\), then using\n\\[\n(1 + (-1))^{n+1} = \\sum C_{k}^{n+1}(-1)^{n+1-k} = (n+1)! \\sum_{k=0}^{n+1} \\frac{(-1)^{n+1-k}}{k! (n+1-k)!}\n\\]\nBy substituting \\(b_k = \\frac{(-1)^k}{k!}\\) for \\(k \\le n\\), we have\n\\[\n(-1)^{n+1} / (n+1)~! = -\\sum_{k=1}^{n+1} \\frac{1}{k!} b_{n-k}\n\\]\nSo \\(b_{n+1} = \\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{(n+1)!}\\).

    "text": "6. Expansion near pole\n\nAssuming the result of problem 5 and the bonus problem, show that if \\(f (z) = g(z)/h(z)\\) has a pole at \\(z = 0\\), that we can expand \\(f(z)\\) in a series\n\\[\nf (z) = \\sum_{n=-m}^{\\infty} a_n z^n\n\\]\nfor some \\(m\\), and that this converges in a “punctured disc” \\(\\{ z | |z| &lt; R, z \\ne 0 \\}\\). Make such an expansion for \\(f (z) = z/(1 + z^2)\\) around \\(z = i\\) (hint: for this example we use tricks with geometric series, we don’t need the general recurrence relation).\n\nSince \\(f(z)\\) has a pole at \\(z = 0\\), \\(h(z)\\) must have a zero of order \\(m\\) at \\(z = 0\\)\nGiven this, \\(h(z)\\) can be written as \\(z^m k(z)\\) where \\(k(z)\\) is analytic and non-zero at \\(z = 0\\). Therefore, \\(f(z)\\) can be written as:\n\\[\nf(z) = \\frac{g(z)}{z^m k(z)}\n\\]\nSince \\(k(z)\\) is analytic and non-zero at \\(z = 0\\), there exists a power series \\(\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} b_n z^n\\) such that \\(\\frac{1}{k(z)} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} b_n z^n\\) . This leads to:\n\\[\nf(z) = \\frac{g(z)}{z^m} \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} b_n z^n = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} b_n g(z) z^{n-m}\n\\]\nfor \\(z \\ne 0\\). As \\(g(z)\\) is analytic at \\(z = 0\\), it can also be expanded into a power series around \\(z = 0\\). Thus, the product of these two series results in a series of the form:\n\\[\nf(z) = \\sum_{n=-m}^{\\infty} a_n z^n\n\\]\nThis series converges in some punctured disc \\(\\{ z \\,|\\, |z| &lt; R, z \\ne 0 \\}\\) because it is the product of two convergent power series in that region.\nFor the specific function \\(f(z) = \\frac{z}{1 + z^2}\\), we want to expand around \\(z = i\\)\n\\[\nf(z) = \\frac{z}{(z - i)(z + i)}\n\\]\nTo expand around \\(z = i\\), let’s set \\(w = z - i\\), so \\(z = w + i\\). Then:\n\\[\nf(w + i) = \\frac{w + i}{ w (w + 2i)}\n\\]\nNow, observe that:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{w + 2i} = \\frac{1}{2i} \\cdot \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{w}{2i}}\n\\]\nSince \\(|\\frac{w}{2i}| &lt; 1\\) for \\(|w| &lt; 2\\), we can use the geometric series expansion:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{w}{2i}} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\left(-\\frac{w}{2i}\\right)^n\n\\]\nThus, we get:\n\\[\nf(z) = \\frac{w + i}{2i w } \\cdot \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\left(-\\frac{w}{2i}\\right)^n\n\\]\nwhich will be valid in a punctured disc around \\(z = i\\), specifically for \\(|z - i| &lt; 2\\) (or \\(|w| &lt; 2\\)).",

Remove the offset from the data.\nWith the spin plane offsets removed, obtain the 3rd component (Z) for times when the Bfield is at a large angle relative to the spin plane (&gt;10 deg or more) using the E*B=0 approximation.\nCompare your estimate of Ez with the measurement of the same component made by the axial electric field boom pair. How large are the offsets for the axial field compared to those you have found for the spin plane components?\n\nNote: A crib sheet and a jupyter notebook on how to perform the offset removal and EdotB determination are my_thm_efi_load_cal_crib.pyspd and my_thm_efi_load_cal_crib.py, located in the class notes below Lecture 12. Use a different spacecraft for your solution. A good day for THEMIS is another spacecraft from the first Science paper (2008-02-26 4-6UT)– except TH-D which is in the released crib sheet. A good day for MMS is the first Science paper (2015-10-16 13:05-13:08UT) from any of the four MMS spacecraft.\nWe choose MMS for this question.

The thicker the Al layer, the higher the threshold energy.\n\\[E=E(d)\\]\nMore generally, the threshold energy \\(E\\) also depends the incident particle \\(s\\).\n\\[E=E(d,s)\\]\n\n\nCode\nimport Pkg\nPkg.add(\"YAML\")\nPkg.add(\"DataFrames\")\nPkg.add(\"Gadfly\")\nPkg.add(\"Unitful\")\n\nusing YAML\nusing DataFrames\nusing Gadfly\nusing Unitful\n\n\n\n\nCode\nfunction parse_result_line(line)\n    values = split(line, ',')\n    Layer = parse(Int, values[1])\n    Thickness = parse(Float64, values[2])  # Assuming thickness in cm\n    Density = parse(Float64, values[3])    # Assuming density in g/cm3\n    Dose = parse(Float64, values[4])       # Assuming dose in keV\n    Error = try\n        parse(Float64, values[5])\n    catch _\n        NaN\n    end  # Handle '-nan' and other errors\n\n    return (Layer, Thickness, Density, Dose, Error)\nend\n\nfunction convert_data(yaml_data)\n    # Iterate through the data and convert each field\n    for entry in yaml_data\n        entry[\"layer.Al.thickness\"] = parse(Float64, replace(entry[\"layer.Al.thickness\"], \" um\" =&gt; \"\")) * 1000 * u\"nm\"\n        entry[\"source\"][\"energy\"] = parse(Float64, replace(entry[\"source\"][\"energy\"], \" MeV\" =&gt; \"\")) * 1000\n        entry[\"result\"] = [parse_result_line(line) for line in split(entry[\"result\"], '\\n') if line != \"\"]\n    end\n\n    df = DataFrame(\n        IncidentEnergy=[entry[\"source\"][\"energy\"] for entry in yaml_data],\n        DepositedEnergy=[entry[\"result\"][3][4] for entry in yaml_data],\n        SourceParticle=[entry[\"source\"][\"particle\"] for entry in yaml_data],\n        LayerAlThickness=[entry[\"layer.Al.thickness\"] for entry in yaml_data],\n    )\n    \n    return df\nend\n\n\nconvert_data (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nfunction read_data(filename = \"result.yml\")\n    # Read YAML file or string\n    filepath = joinpath(@__DIR__, \"run\", filename)\n    # Parse YAML content\n    parsed_data = YAML.load_file(filepath)\n\n    # Convert data to DataFrame\n    df = convert_data(parsed_data)\n\n    return df\nend\n\n\nread_data (generic function with 2 methods)\n\n\nThe result from SPENVIS is stored in a yaml file.

    "text": "Differentiate monoenergetic ions\n\nDemonstrate that with a sufficient number of detectors you could differentiate monoenergetic protons, He+ and O+.\n\nAssuming the Protons constitute \\(n_1\\) percen, He+ \\(n_2\\), and O+ \\(n_3\\) of the incoming beam. For three unknown variables \\(n_1\\), \\(n_2\\), \\(n_3\\), we need at least three detectors to solve the equation system. With the first detector recording the total incoming energy \\(E_1\\), the second detector \\(E_2\\), and the third detector \\(E_3\\), we have the following equation system:\n\\[E_1 = n_1 E + n_2 E + n_3 E\\] \\[E_2 = n_1 \\alpha_{2,p} E + n_2 \\alpha_{2,He+} E + n_3 \\alpha_{2,O+} E\\] \\[E_3 = n_1 \\alpha_{3,p} E + n_2 \\alpha_{3,He+} E + n_3 \\alpha_{3,O+} E\\]\nwhere \\(\\alpha_{2,p}\\), \\(\\alpha_{2,He+}\\), \\(\\alpha_{2,O+}\\), \\(\\alpha_{3,p}\\), \\(\\alpha_{3,He+}\\), \\(\\alpha_{3,O+}\\) are 1- the energy loss ratio of protons, He+ and O+ in the Al layer of the second and third detector respectively.\nSince $_{i,p} $ can be determined from experiment/simulation, we can solve the above equation to get \\(n_1\\), \\(n_2\\), \\(n_3\\).\nIf we want to well differentiate monoenergetic protons, He+ and O+ with energy \\(E\\), we can reverse the relationship \\(E=E(d,s)\\) to get the thickness of the Al layer \\(d\\) for each ion. This is possible because theoretically the threshold energy \\(E\\) is a monotonic increasing function of the thickness of the Al layer \\(d\\).\n\\[d=d(E,s)\\]\nSo for a detector with a thickness \\(d_{O+}=d(E,O+)\\) of the Al layer, we only detect the deposited energy of protons and He+ in the Si layer. And for a detector with a thickness \\(d_{He+}=d(E,He+)\\) of the Al layer, we only detect the deposited energy of protons in the Si layer.\nThen we have additional \\(\\alpha_{2,O+}=0\\) and \\(\\alpha_{3,O+}=\\alpha_{3,He+}=0\\) in the equation system, simplifying the equation system to:\n\\[E_1 = n_1 E + n_2 E + n_3 E\\] \\[E_2 = n_1 \\alpha_{2,p} E + n_2 \\alpha_{2,He+} E\\] \\[E_3 = n_1 \\alpha_{3,p} E\\]\nTo demonstrate the differentiation, suppose the energy of the incoming beam is \\(E=100\\) keV.\nFrom the Figure 2, we can use the following thickness of the Al layer to differentiate the three ions:\n\n\\(d_{1} = d_{O+} \\approx 300 nm\\)\n\\(d_{2} = d_{He+} \\approx 610 nm\\)\n\nAnd we have \\(\\alpha_{2,p} \\approx 0.59\\), \\(\\alpha_{2,He+} \\approx 0.38\\) and \\(\\alpha_{3,p} \\approx 0.22\\) from the simulation. The equation is solvable.\n\n\nCode\ndf2 = read_data(\"result_2.yml\")\n\n\n15×4

You will use freeware Geant-4 which simulates particle interaction with matter, through a portal: SPENVIS. Various models exist there (very useful site!).\nFirst you have to register, then create a project, then input your model input and output parameters, then make a run and get results one-energy-at-a-time. Once you know how to do that, then you must create an array of inputs and outputs outside of SPENVIS in your favorite plotting package (e.g., excel, python or other). You will then record those results and plot them, one array for protons, another for He+ and another for O+. You can try other species as well, for example O2+ which may be present in the low altitude ionosphere.\n\nAssume monoenergetic beams. The program allows you to use a simple ion spectrum. (For the bonus question you have to make a guess on the instrument response function, model it in a simple analytical form, then prove it can be done using Geant-4. You do not have to do the bonus.)\n\nFor your report, you should not repeat the steps I mention below, but just execute your outline above and go right to the findings, plots and discussion. In the discussion explain how you use the model to design a detector system (how many detectors, thicknesses, orientations etc) that does the job.\n\nOn SPENVIS after registration, name your project and proceed to use Geant-4 “MULASSIS”. You can save your run, and come back to it later.\nYour system will be a 3 layer system, where the first layer is air, the second Al of variable thickness and the third Silicon of a mm or two... enough to stop the highest energy of interest. You shoot some particles (10,000 is a good number), and record how much energy is deposited in Si. Excluding losses in the Si (phonons) the lost energy is mainly due to losses in the Aluminum. Pick the source parameters: How many/which ions, charge angle (-22 deg -&gt; 22 deg).\nFor Geometry you pick the layers above, and for Al choose 0, 1, 10 100 nm, one thickness at a time.\nSpecify the input as monoenergetic beam.\nSpecify analysis parameters as mean energy (the mean energy deposited based on the 10,000 particle run)\nCreate a macro (a bunch of commands that tell Geant-4 what to do) and Run.\nSee the plot\nOutput results (2 numbers) into your program next to input energy to build the in/out energy curve.\nRepeat, one point at a time.\nPlot results for one species and then (in different color) for other species.\nRepeat for different Al thicknesses.",
