You will find the current moves towards the source in the upper-right part of the wing and away from the source in the upper-left.

    "section": "Introduction and Background",
    "text": "Introduction and Background\nSolar wind magnetic discontinuities, characterized by rapid variations in interplanetary magnetic fields, are pivotal in understanding key phenomena in heliophysics. These discontinuities, manifesting as localized transient rotations or jumps in the magnetic field, are among the first discoveries in solar wind investigations (Colburn and Sonett 1966). Theoretical models suggest that the formation and destruction of discontinuities are closely related to the nonlinear dynamics of Alfvén waves. These nonlinear processes can create significant isolated disturbances to the otherwise adiabatic evolution of the solar wind flow.\nThese discontinuities change the local direction of the interplanetary magnetic field (deviating from the average Parker spiral) and contribute significantly to the magnetic fluctuation spectrum (Borovsky 2010). They harbor kinetic-scale structures with intense currents, which act as a source of free energy for plasma waves and instabilities, leading to energy dissipation(Dmitruk, Matthaeus, and Seenu 2004; MacBride, Smith, and Forman 2008; Osman et al. 2012; Tessein et al. 2013). Their formation, evolution, and destruction are believed to be closely related to solar wind heating and acceleration via magnetic reconnection (Dmitruk, Matthaeus, and Seenu 2004) or nonlinear wave-wave and wave-particle interaction (Medvedev et al. 1997). Moreover, discontinuities are coherent structures in turbulent solar wind and have a nontrivial influence (distinct from random fluctuations) on energetic particles whose gyroradius is comparable to the thickness of the discontinuity (Malara, Perri, and Zimbardo 2021). Recent investigation of the nonfluid (kinetic) properties of solar wind discontinuities (Artemyev et al. 2019) reveals that electron density and temperature vary significantly across these discontinuities, underlining the importance of kinetic effects in discontinuity structure.\nUnderstanding the dynamics of solar wind discontinuities is essential for elucidating the fundamental processes that govern the solar wind’s evolution as it travels through the heliosphere. As such, this study aims to address the key question:\n“How do discontinuities evolve over radial distances from the Sun and what are the physical mechanisms behind their formation and evolution?”\nBy leveraging data from missions such as PSP and Juno, this research will generate a comprehensive data set of discontinuity configurations and investigate their spatial and temporal evolution. These statistics will aid in modeling processes like ion scattering by coherent structures and elucidate their roles in solar wind heating and particle acceleration.\n\nPrevious Studies and Context\nSpacecraft investigations of the space plasma environment have revealed that the solar wind magnetic field follows the Parker model of the heliospheric current sheet only on average. Localized transient currents, which can be significantly more intense than the model currents, are carried by various discontinuities observed as strong variations in magnetic field components (Colburn and Sonett 1966; Burlaga 1968; Turner and Siscoe 1971). Most often, such variations are manifested as magnetic field rotations within the plane of two most fluctuating components.\n\nFurther advancements were made with data from the Helios-1, Helios-2, Ulysses, and Voyager missions, which explored discontinuities in three-dimensional space, revealing their prevalence and importance throughout the heliosphere (Mariani, Bavassano, and Villante 1983; Tsurutani et al. 1997). As illustrated in Figure 1, these discontinuities are observed at a multitude of radial distances from the Sun. These findings underscored the need to understand the origin of discontinuities, which are thought to arise from dynamic processes on the Sun, including solar flares and coronal mass ejections, as well as through in-situ processes like local magnetic turbulence, magnetic reconnection, and nonlinear wave interactions within the solar wind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Distribution of occurrence rate of solar wind discontinuities (Söding et al. 2001).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Role of Alfven wave and kinetic effects in the discontinuities\nUlysses measurements of the high-latitude solar wind at \\(1-5\\) AU showed that the majority of discontinuities resided within the stream-stream interaction regions and/or within Alfvén wave trains (Tsurutani et al. 1995; Tsurutani and Ho 1999). The nonlinear evolution of Alfvén waves (wave steepening) can be the main cause of such discontinuities. The background plasma/magnetic field inhomogeneities and various dissipative processes are key to Alfvén wave nonlinear evolution . In hybrid simulations and analytical models , this steepening was shown to cause formation of discontinuities in configurations resembling the near-Earth observations. There are models predicting discontinuity formation and destruction due to dissipative processes (e.g., Alfvén wave steepening, magnetic reconnection) in the solar wind. However, the efficiency of these processes in realistic expanding solar wind was not yet tested against observations.\nMore recently, utilizing high-resolution plasma measurements from ARTEMIS and MMS missions, Artemyev et al. (2019) showed that discontinuities have kinetic characteristics for both tangential and rotational discontinuities: fluxes of electrons of different energies vary differently across these discontinuities. These discoveries revealed the importance of ion and electron kinetics to discontinuity structure.\n\n\nCurrent Gaps in Understanding\nPrevious observations of solar wind discontinuities in the outer heliosphere were rarely in conjunction with measurements closer to the Sun. Thus it is presently unclear whether the observed changes in their frequency and properties are due to variations in the solar plasma state resulting from solar variability, such as the solar magnetic activity cycle, or whether these changes are a natural outcome of the discontinuities’ propagation and interaction with the ambient solar wind.\nRegular and long-lasting Juno (2011-2016) and PSP (2019-now) observations, together with almost permanent near-Earth solar wind monitoring, provide a unique opportunity to examine the discontinuity characteristics at two radial distances simultaneously in the context of both the inner and the outer heliosphere over a large radial distance range (\\(\\sim 0.1\\) AU - \\(\\sim 5\\) AU). We will determine the discontinuity occurrence rates and properties for various radial distances and compare these results with the prediction of the adiabatic expansion model to understand if discontinuity formation or destruction dominates the statistics of discontinuities far away from the solar wind acceleration region.\nThis research seeks to address these gaps by leveraging recent advancements in observational capabilities and numerical modeling to provide a comprehensive examination of solar wind discontinuities."

    "text": "Methodology\nData Collection and Model:\nParker Solar Probe and Juno provide high-resolution magnetic field and plasma data from the inner heliosphere to beyond 1 AU. The PSP’s close passes to the Sun offer unique insights into the nascent solar wind, while Juno’s trajectory up to Jupiter allows for studying the evolution of solar wind structures as they propagate outward.\nThe solar wind plasma state, as evidenced by the sunspot number (referenced in panel (c) of Figure 2), plays a crucial role in understanding the dynamics of discontinuities. During the initial phase of the JUNO mission, the sunspot number reached its peak, indicating a period of heightened solar activity. However, by the end of the mission’s cruise phase, there was a significant decline in solar activity. This variation underscores the importance of calibrating the discontinuity properties in relation to solar activity levels to account for temporal fluctuations.\nFurther analysis of Figure 2 highlights the significance of the heliographic longitudinal difference between the Juno mission and Earth as well as the STEREO-A mission. Specifically, when there is a substantial longitudinal difference between Juno and Earth, the difference between Juno and STEREO-A tends to be minimal, and vice versa. This longitudinal discrepancy between Earth and STEREO-A ensures comprehensive coverage of the plasma en route to Juno.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Overview. a, Juno orbit during its cruise phase (2011-2016). b, Difference of heliographic longitude of Juno and 1-AU missions. c, monthly and smoothed sunspot number. d-g, Near-Earth (OMNI) and STEREO-A solar wind plasma density and speed.\n\n\n\nDatasets from missions such as STEREO, ARTEMIS, and WIND will complement observations from PSP and Juno, offering a broader contextual perspective on heliospheric conditions and enabling a multi-point analysis of discontinuity properties (Velli et al. 2020). The table below summarizes the time resolution of magnetic field and plasma data for PSP, Juno, Wind, ARTEMIS, and STEREO. However, since Juno does not provide direct plasma measurements, we will estimate the spatial scale (thickness) of discontinuities using solar wind speed derived from solar wind propagation models. Specifically, we will employ the Two-Dimensional Outer Heliosphere Solar Wind Modeling (MSWIM2D) (Keebler et al. 2022) to determine the ion bulk velocity (\\(v\\)) and plasma density (\\(n\\)) at Juno’s location. This model, which utilizes the BATSRUS MHD solver, simulates the solar wind propagation from 1 to 75 astronomical units (AU) in the ecliptic plane, effectively covering the region pertinent to our study. The MSWIM2D model provides output data with an hourly time resolution as shown in Figure 6. The comparison of magnetic field magnitudes from MSWIM2D with those measured by Juno, after averaging to the same time resolution, reveals a strong correlation, confirming the model’s reliability.\n\n\n\nMission\nδt(B)\nδt(plasma)\n\n\n\n\nParker Solar Probe\n~200 Hz\n0.25-1 Hz\n\n\nJuno\n1 Hz\n1 hour\n\n\nARTEMIS\n5 Hz\n0.25 Hz\n\n\nWIND\n11 Hz\n1 Hz\n\n\nSTEREO\n8 Hz\n1 min\n\n\n\nDiscontinuity Identification and Analysis:\nThis first step in understanding the evolution of solar wind discontinuities involves identifying and characterizing these structures. We will adopt Liu’s method (Liu et al. 2022) for this purpose. This approach provides better compatibility for discontinuities with small magnetic field changes and demonstrates greater robustness for conditions in the outer heliosphere compared to traditional methods, namely the B-criterion (Burlaga 1969) and the TS-criterion (Tsurutani and Smith 1979). For each sampling time \\(t\\), we define three intervals: the pre-interval \\([-1,-1/2]\\cdot τ+t\\), the middle interval \\([-1/2,1/2]\\cdot τ+t\\), and the post-interval \\([1/2,1]\\cdot τ+t\\), where \\(τ\\) represents time lags. The magnetic field timeseries in these three intervals are labeled as \\({\\mathbf B}_-\\), \\({\\mathbf B}_0\\), and \\({\\mathbf B}_+\\), respectively. To identify a discontinuity, the following three conditions must be met:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sigma({\\mathbf B}_0) &&gt; 2\\max\\left(\\sigma({\\mathbf B}_-), \\sigma({\\mathbf B}_+)\\right) \\\\\n\\sigma\\left({\\mathbf B}_-+{\\mathbf B}_+\\right) &&gt;\\sigma({\\mathbf B}_-)+\\sigma({\\mathbf B}_+) \\\\\n|\\Delta {\\mathbf B}| &&gt;|{\\mathbf B}_{bg}|/10\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nHere, \\(\\sigma\\) denotes the standard deviation, \\({\\mathbf B}_{bg}\\) represents the background magnetic field magnitude, and \\(\\Delta {\\mathbf B}={\\mathbf B}(t+τ/2)-{\\mathbf B}(t-τ/2)\\). The first two conditions ensure that the field changes are distinguishable from stochastic fluctuations, while the third condition serves as a supplementary measure to reduce recognition uncertainty. Notably, this method shares certain similarities with the Partial Variance of Increments (PVI) approach for identifying coherent structures, as both calculate indices based on standard deviations (with this method focusing on the standard deviation of the magnetic field, and PVI on magnetic field increments). However, this method is better suited for discontinuity identification by comparing data within neighboring time windows rather than across a correlation scale (an unknown quantity that may vary with radial distance and solar wind conditions). As a result, this approach effectively excludes wave-like coherent structures, eliminating the need for manual inspection and bypassing the necessity of grouping continuous clusters of high-PVI points as in PVI analysis.\nSubsequently, for each identified discontinuity, we calculate the distance matrix of the time series sequence (the distance between each pair of magnetic field vectors) to ascertain its leading and trailing edges.\nAfter that, we use the minimum or maximum variance analysis (MVA) analysis (Bengt U. Ö. Sonnerup and Scheible 1998; B. U. Ö. Sonnerup and Cahill Jr. 1967) to transform the magnetic field into the boundary normal (LMN) coordinate system.\nThe main (most varying) magnetic field component, \\(B_l\\), is then fitted by a hyperbolic tangent function to extract the parameters to properly describe the discontinuity Equation 1. Then we combine the magnetic field data and plasma data to obtain the thickness and the current density of the discontinuity.\n\\[\nB_l(t) = B_{l0} \\tanh\\left(\\frac{t - t_0}{\\Delta T}\\right) + c_l\n\\tag{1}\\]\nWhile previous studies (Vasko et al. 2021, 2022), typically using data from a single spacecraft, often calculate current intensity by taking the derivative of the time series, our study must account for the varying time resolutions of different spacecraft. To address this, we fit the data to achieve a more precise representation of the peak current density, \\(J_m = - \\frac{1}{\\mu_0 V_n} \\frac{d B_l}{d t}\\), thereby minimizing the impact of time resolution discrepancies.\nExamples of solar wind discontinuities detected by various spacecraft are illustrated in Figure 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Discontinuities detected by PSP, Juno, STEREO and near-Earth ARTEMIS satellite: red, blue, and black lines are \\(B_l\\), \\(B_m\\), and \\(|{\\mathbf B}|\\).\n\n\n\n\nProposed Approach:\nTwo promising approaches are proposed for studying the evolution of solar wind discontinuities:\n1. Conjunction Events Analysis: This approach involves studying instances where spacecraft are simultaneously aligned along the same spiral field line, thus measuring solar wind emanating from the same solar surface region, or positioned to measure the same solar wind plasma (Velli et al. 2020). The latter alignment is determined by the difference in radial distance, \\(\\delta R\\), corresponding to the solar wind travel time, \\(\\tau = \\delta R / V_{sw}\\).\nAn example demonstrating this approach is presented in Figure 4, showcasing similar trends in magnetic field magnitude, plasma density, velocity, and temperature observed by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) during an alignment period in April 2019. Validation is further supported by utilizing the statistical plasma expansion model (Perrone et al. 2019), where the plasma properties measured by PSP and projected to the ACE location exhibit good agreement with actual ACE measurements, as depicted in Figure 7. This confirms the validity of the alignment approach for studying solar wind discontinuities.\n2. Comparative Analysis: This approach leverages extensive data collected over the years to compare solar wind discontinuities observed by different spacecraft at various radial distances. Due to the Sun’s rapid rotation, solar wind plasma emitted from a single region on the solar surface sweeps across the entire heliosphere within a solar rotation period of 27 days. By utilizing solar wind measurements at 1 AU from STEREO, ARTEMIS, and WIND, and comparing these with data from Juno and PSP, it is possible to distinguish between the effects of temporal variations in solar wind and those due to spatial variations (associated with radial distance from the Sun) in the occurrence rate and characteristics of discontinuities. An example of such a comparison for the occurrence rate is depicted in Figure 5, where the number of discontinuities measured per day by different spacecraft missions is plotted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Measurement by PSP and ACE spacecrafts from 2019-04-06 to 2019-04-10. From top to bottom: (a) Magnetic field magnitude measured (b) Plasma density, (c) Plasma velocity, (d) Plasma temperature.\n\n\n\nIn the proposed study, we will expand this comparison to include the properties of discontinuities, such as thickness, strength (current density), and orientation.\nThis extension will enable us to grasp how these features evolve with radial distance from the Sun and how they relate to the local plasma properties. Examining these properties is crucial for understanding the generation of discontinuities.\nBorovsky (2008) argued that solar wind discontinuities act as static boundaries between flux tubes originating at the solar surface and they are convected passively from the source regions. However, Greco et al. (2009), by examining the waiting time distribution of magnetic ﬁeld increments, discovered a good agreement between MHD simulations and observations. This finding suggests that discontinuities stem from intermittent MHD turbulence, indicating local generation.\nIf turbulence theory holds true, discontinuities properties should align with local plasma parameters; conversely, if propagation theory is accurate, discontinuity properties should be consistent with the solar wind expansion model. Studying these properties will provide insights into the physical mechanisms governing discontinuity formation and spatial evolution as solar wind propagates through the heliosphere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: The number of discontinuities measured by Juno per day coincides with the discontinuity number measured by STEREO, WIND, and ARTEMIS, when Juno is around \\(1\\) AU. This number (occurrence rate) decreases with distance (with time after \\(\\sim 2013\\)), as Juno moves from \\(1\\) AU to \\(5\\) AU. We will use the similar comparison for discontinuity characteristics and occurrence rate derived for PSP and Juno."

    "text": "Analysis Approach\nFirst, we will identify specific events during which intense EMIC wave activity coincides with significant changes in electron fluxes. These events will be used as case studies to analyze the interaction mechanisms in detail, employing cross-spectral analysis to examine the coherence between EMIC waves and electron flux oscillations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Two ELFIN CubeSats observations of EMIC wave-driven electron precipitation, where the precipitating flux reaches the trapped flux in high-energy channels, over an interval exceeding three hours, from 02:42 to 05:53 UT. The locations are projected to the equatorial L-Shell and MLT, using the Tsyganenko89 magnetic field model. Panels (a), (b), and (d) show data from ELFIN-B, while panel (c) features observations from ELFIN-A.\n\n\n\nFigure 2 (adapted from Fig 5 of Angelopoulos et al. (2023)) shows a clear example of the EMIC wave-driven electron precipitation observed by ELFIN CubeSats. We observe a high precipitating-to-trapped flux ratio \\(j_{prec}/j_{trap}\\) during four ELFIN orbits.\nWithin \\(L \\in [5,6]\\) there is a peak of precipitating-to-trapped flux ratio above \\(300\\) keV. This peak moves from \\(L \\sim 6\\) around 02:45 UT to \\(L \\sim 5\\) at 05:15 UT. Only EMIC wave-driven precipitation may have a low-energy cut-off of scattering fluxes around \\(\\sim 500\\) keV, which is a typical minimum resonance energy for EMIC waves (see the identification of other EMIC wave-driven precipitation events with similar precipitating-to-trapped ratios in An et al. 2022; Angelopoulos et al. 2023). Note that the efficient precipitation (large \\(j_{prec}/j_{trap}\\)) observed at \\(L&gt;6.5\\) is likely due to a combination of whistler-mode wave-driven precipitation (Shi et al. 2022) and precipitation due to the curvature scattering (Wilkins et al. 2023), while precipitation of \\(&lt;300\\) keV electrons at \\(L&lt;5\\) is driven by whistler-mode wave scattering (see similar examples of quasi-periodical precipitation on the dusk flank in Artemyev et al. 2021).\nTherefore, Figure 2 demonstrates that during at least three hours, ELFIN observed continuous EMIC wave-driven losses of relativistic electrons. As \\(j_{prec}/j_{trap}\\) for \\(\\sim\\) 0.3–1 MeV electrons reaches one, the strong diffusion regime, one may expect a significant depletion of equatorial electron flux in this energy range, at least at low pitch-angles.\nTo further confirm the role of EMIC waves in driving electron precipitation, we will utilize phase space density calculations and quasi-linear theory to analyze how EMIC waves scatter radiation belt electrons into the loss cone, leading to precipitation. By quantifying the diffusion coefficients, we can better understand the rate and extent of changes in electron flux.\nIn the limit of near-equilibrium of the electron distribution near the loss-cone (Kennel and Petschek 1966) the average precipitating electron flux measured within the loss-cone by ELFIN CubeSats at low altitude, \\(j_{prec}\\), can be expressed as a function of the trapped flux measured at an equatorial pitch-angle \\(5\\)% above the loss-cone angle \\(\\alpha_{LC}\\), denoted \\(j_{trap}\\) (Mourenas et al. 2023). In the ELFIN data products, \\(j_{prec}\\) is averaged over the loss cone weighted by solid angle, giving \\(j_{prec}/j_{trap}\\approx 1.3/(z_0+z_0^2/200)\\) with \\(z_0=2\\alpha_{LC}/(\\tau_B D_{\\alpha\\alpha})^{1/2}\\) and \\(\\tau_B\\) the electron bounce period, valid for \\(j_{prec}/j_{trap}\\in[0.001,0.85]\\).\nAccordingly, \\(D_{\\alpha\\alpha}\\) at \\(\\alpha_0=\\alpha_{LC}\\) can be inferred from the measured ratio \\(j_{prec}/j_{trap}\\) at ELFIN, giving \\(D_{\\alpha\\alpha} \\approx \\frac{{\\alpha_{LC}^2}}{{2500\\, \\tau_B }} \\left(\\sqrt{1+ \\frac{{ j_{trap} }}{{ 38.5\\, j_{prec} }} } -1 \\right)^{-2}\\).\nThe diffusion rates \\(D_{\\alpha\\alpha}\\) inferred, using the above Equation, from time-averaged ELFIN measurements of precipitating and trapped electron fluxes are displayed in Figure 3 for different electron energies and different \\(L\\). In the noon-dusk sector of the plasmaspheric plume, despite the theoretical impossibility of cyclotron resonance between 0.5-2 MeV electrons and typical EMIC wave frequencies, observed electron precipitation at these energies continues, particularly for low-energy electrons via scattering with high-frequency, low-amplitude H-band EMIC waves.\nThese results suggest the presence of duskside EMIC wave bursts with peak amplitudes \\(B_w\\approx 0.5\\) nT and a low-amplitude component at frequencies above those of peak-amplitude.\nThis estimate of electron lifetime by EMIC waves is based on analytical quasi-linear diffusion theory with realistic wave and plasma parameters, which allows us to simplify the dispersion relation and the diffusion coefficients. However, in general, quasi-linear diffusion by EMIC waves alone cannot lead to strong and fast dropouts of 2–6 MeV electrons up to high pitch angles, as there is no cyclotron resonance between these electrons and EMIC waves above the maximum resonance pitch angle \\(\\alpha_{0,\\max}\\). This prevents the majority of the electron population from being scattered toward the loss cone, except if the bottleneck in the bounce-averaged pitch angle diffusion rate \\(D_{\\alpha\\alpha}(\\text{EMIC})\\) at high \\(\\alpha_0\\) can be filled by other kinds of waves. Therefore, in the proposed study, we will extend the quasi-linear diffusion analysis to chorus waves and further investigate the combined effects of EMIC and chorus waves on radiation belt electrons. By utilizing the observed wave properties with the aid of theoretical predictions, we aim to elucidate the underlying mechanisms that drive electron dynamics during storm-time events."

Using data from satellite missions like ELFIN, Van Allen Probes, and ERG (Arase), we will examine how EMIC waves alter electron fluxes during storms, particularly alongside whistler-mode waves. By analyzing case studies and applying diffusion coefficients, we aim to assess how EMIC waves influence electron pitch angles and precipitation. Ultimately, this study seeks to compare the effects of EMIC and whistler-mode waves to determine when EMIC waves dominate electron loss processes."

    "text": "2 Gravitational Frequency Shift\nSuppose you are standing in your “laboratory,” a steel box of height l. The laboratory is sitting on the Earth, so you and everything in it feel a downward gravitational acceleration of magnitude \\(g = 10 m s^{−2}\\) (don’t use the numerical value in this problem, just call it g).\n\nIf you drop a ball from rest at the top of the box, it hits the bottom after a time \\(t\\), where \\(g t^2/2 = l\\). Show that its kinetic energy at the bottom of the box is \\(E_b = m l g\\).\nYour friend is in a similar laboratory in space, far enough away from the Earth that its gravity is negligible. She has attached a laser to the ceiling of her laboratory, pointing down towards a light detector on the floor. The laser emits photons that have frequency νt. The detector at the bottom can measure the frequency (and hence the color) of photons that it receives. If the laboratory were floating freely in space, then the frequency of the photons received at the bottom would be νb = νt. How long does it take photons to go from the top of the box to the bottom? (Give an equation for the time tb in terms of l and c.)\n\nNow suppose that your friend’s laboratory is not floating freely but is being towed by a rocket that is accelerating upwards (in the frame of your friend) with acceleration a = 10 m s−2. By the time the light reaches the bottom, therefore, the box is moving upwards with a speed vbox = at. What is the frequency νb of photons measured by a detector bolted to the floor at the bottom of the box? (Give a formula expressing \\(ν_b\\) in terms of νt, a, l, and c.) Are the photons at the bottom bluer or redder than those emitted at the top? Hint: You can assume that the travel time is the same as in (b) so long as \\(v_{box}&lt;&lt;c\\).\n\nRemember that the energy of a photon with frequency ν is E = hν. Show that the photons received at the bottom of the box have greater energy than those emitted at the top of the box by an amount ≈ Et × (al/c2).\n\nYou install an identical laser and light detector in your laboratory on the earth. The laser again emits photons with frequency νt. Apply the equivalence principle discussed in class to answer the following questions: (i) Are the photons received at the bottom bluer, redder, or the same color as those emitted at the top? (ii) Do photons gain energy, lose energy, or keep the same energy as they fall through the box? (iii) What is the amount of energy that a photon gains or loses as it falls through the box?

How close, again in units of the Schwarzschild radius, could the astronaut get to this black hole?\n\n\nThe code for the calculations is as follows:\n\n\nCode\nh = 180.0 * u.cm             # Height of astronaut in cm\ng_max = 9 * g0   # Maximum sustainable acceleration\n\ndef tidal_acceleration(M, h, r):\n    \"\"\"tidal acceleration\"\"\"\n    return (2 * G * M * h) / (r ** 3)\n\ndef closest_approach(M, h, a_max):\n    return (2 * G * M * h / a_max) ** (1/3)\n\ndef r_schwarzchild(r, R_s):\n    return (r / R_s).to(u.dimensionless_unscaled)\n\n# Part (b): Tidal acceleration at Schwarzschild radius for a stellar-mass black hole\ndef part_b(M_mass_solar):\n    M = M_mass_solar * M_sun\n    R_s = schwarzschild_radius(M)\n    a_tidal = tidal_acceleration(M, h, R_s)\n    return a_tidal\n\n# Part (c): Closest approach without spaghettification for a stellar-mass black hole\ndef part_c(M_mass_solar):\n    M = M_mass_solar * M_sun\n    R_s = schwarzschild_radius(M)\n    r = closest_approach(M, h, g_max)\n    return r_schwarzchild(r, R_s)\n\n# Part (d): Tidal acceleration and closest approach for a supermassive black hole\ndef part_d(M_mass_solar):\n    M = M_mass_solar * M_sun\n    R_s = schwarzschild_radius(M)\n    a_tidal = tidal_acceleration(M, h, R_s)\n    r = closest_approach(M, h, g_max)\n    return a_tidal, r_schwarzchild(r, R_s)  # (Tidal acceleration, Closest approach in R_s)\n\n# Part (b)\nM_star = 10  # Stellar-mass black hole: 10 solar masses\na_tidal_b = part_b(M_star)\nprint(f\"Part (b):\")\nprint(f\"Acceleration due to tidal forces at Schwarzschild radius for {M_star} M_sun black hole:\")\nprint(f\"a_tidal ≈ {a_tidal_b:.2e}\\n\")\n\n# Part (c)\nclosest_r_b = part_c(M_star)\nprint(f\"Part (c):\")\nprint(f\"Closest approach without spaghettification for {M_star} M_sun black hole:\")\nprint(f\"r ≈ {closest_r_b:.2f} Schwarzschild radii\\n\")\n\n# Part (d)\nM_super = 1e6  # Supermassive black hole: 10^6 solar masses\na_tidal_d, closest_r_d = part_d(M_super)\nprint(f\"Part (d):\")\nprint(f\"Tidal acceleration at Schwarzschild radius for {M_super:.0e} M_sun black hole:\")\nprint(f\"a_tidal ≈ {a_tidal_d:.2e}\")\nprint(f\"Closest approach without spaghettification:\")\nprint(f\"r ≈ {closest_r_d:.2e} Schwarzschild radii\")\n\n\nPart (b):\nAcceleration due to tidal forces at Schwarzschild radius for 10 M_sun black hole:\na_tidal ≈ 1.85e+10 cm / s2\n\nPart (c):\nClosest approach without spaghettification for 10 M_sun black hole:\nr ≈ 128.09 Schwarzschild radii\n\nPart (d):\nTidal acceleration at Schwarzschild radius for 1e+06 M_sun black hole:\na_tidal ≈ 1.85e+00 cm / s2\nClosest approach without spaghettification:\nr ≈ 5.95e-02 Schwarzschild radii\n\n\n\n4.1 Tidal Force\nUsing the approximation \\(h \\ll r\\)\n\\[\nF_{\\text{head}} = \\frac{G M m}{\\left(r - \\frac{h}{2}\\right)^2} \\approx \\frac{G M m}{r^2} \\left(1 + \\frac{h}{r}\\right)\n\\]\n\\[\nF_{\\text{toe}} = \\frac{G M m}{\\left(r + \\frac{h}{2}\\right)^2} \\approx \\frac{G M m}{r^2} \\left(1 - \\frac{h}{r}\\right)\n\\]\nSi the tidal force is:\n\\[\nF_{\\text{tidal}} = F_{\\text{head}} - F_{\\text{toe}} \\approx \\frac{2 G M m h}{r^3}\n\\]\n\n\n\n4.2 Acceleration of Tidal Forces\n\\[\na_{\\text{tidal}} = \\frac{F_{\\text{tidal}}}{m} = \\frac{2 G M h}{R_s^3} = \\frac{2 G M h}{(2 G M / c^2)^3} = \\frac{c^6 h}{4 G^2 M^2}\n\\]\nSubstituting the given values:\n\\[\na_{\\text{tidal}} = 1.86 \\times 10^{10} cm/s²\n\\]\n\n\n\n4.3 Closest Approach Without Spaghettification\nSet \\(a_{\\text{tidal}} = a_{\\text{max}}= 9g\\) :\n\\[\n\\frac{2 G M h}{r^3} = a_{\\text{max}} \\implies r = \\left( \\frac{2 G M h}{a_{\\text{max}}} \\right)^{1/3}\n\\]\nGiven \\(2 G M = R_s c^2\\) :\n\\[\n\\implies r = R_s \\left( \\frac{h c^2}{a_{\\text{max}} R_s^2} \\right)^{1/3}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{r}{R_s} = \\frac{3.78 \\times 10^8}{2.95 \\times 10^6} \\approx 128\n\\]\n\n\n4.4 Supermassive Black Hole\n\\[\na_{\\text{tidal}} \\approx 1.85 cm/s²\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{r}{R_s} \\approx 6 \\times 10^{-2}\n\\]",

Write a short reaction (a paragraph or so) to this video – you could comment on something you learned or particularly enjoyed or pose a question it raised to you, for example.\n\n\nGravitational lensing, where light from surrounding stars bends around the black hole, creating a warped view is so coool. Especially when near the event horizon and orbiting the black hole, the visual distortions are so fascinating. Also it is kind of interesting that why the closest stable orbit is 3 times the Schwarzschild radius.",

Use SPENVIS or GEANT-4 for your modeling.\n\nThe energy loss of particles depends on the nature of particles (mass, charge, etc), the incident energy, and the thickness of the Al layer.\nFor the two-layer detector, where the ﬁrst layer is Al and the second layer is Silicon, the thickness of the Al layer varies from 0 nm to 100 nm with the thickness of the Si layer ﬁxed to 2 mm.\nAs shown in Figure 1, heavier ions like O+ deposits more energy in the Al layer than lighter ions like He+ and H+, leading to a smaller energy recorded by the Si layer.\nAnd for O+ with low incoming energy below a certain energy threshold \\(E\\), the recorded deposited energy in Si layer will drop to zero. This threshold energy \\(E\\) depends on the thickness of the Al layer \\(d\\). The thicker the Al layer, the higher the threshold energy.\n\\[E=E(d)\\]\nMore generally, the threshold energy \\(E\\) also depends the incident particle \\(s\\).\n\\[E=E(d,s)\\]\n\n\nCode\nusing Pkg\nPkg.add([\n    \"YAML\",\n    \"DataFrames\",\n    \"Gadfly\",\n    \"Unitful\",\n])\n\nusing YAML\nusing DataFrames\nusing Gadfly\nusing Unitful\n\n\n\n\nCode\nfunction parse_result_line(line)\n    values = split(line, ',')\n    Layer = parse(Int, values[1])\n    Thickness = parse(Float64, values[2])  # Assuming thickness in cm\n    Density = parse(Float64, values[3])    # Assuming density in g/cm3\n    Dose = parse(Float64, values[4])       # Assuming dose in keV\n    Error = try\n        parse(Float64, values[5])\n    catch _\n        NaN\n    end  # Handle '-nan' and other errors\n\n    return (Layer, Thickness, Density, Dose, Error)\nend\n\nfunction convert_data(yaml_data)\n    # Iterate through the data and convert each field\n    for entry in yaml_data\n        entry[\"layer.Al.thickness\"] = parse(Float64, replace(entry[\"layer.Al.thickness\"], \" um\" =&gt; \"\")) * 1000 * u\"nm\"\n        entry[\"source\"][\"energy\"] = parse(Float64, replace(entry[\"source\"][\"energy\"], \" MeV\" =&gt; \"\")) * 1000\n        entry[\"result\"] = [parse_result_line(line) for line in split(entry[\"result\"], '\\n') if line != \"\"]\n    end\n\n    df = DataFrame(\n        IncidentEnergy=[entry[\"source\"][\"energy\"] for entry in yaml_data],\n        DepositedEnergy=[entry[\"result\"][3][4] for entry in yaml_data],\n        SourceParticle=[entry[\"source\"][\"particle\"] for entry in yaml_data],\n        LayerAlThickness=[entry[\"layer.Al.thickness\"] for entry in yaml_data],\n    )\n\n    return df\nend\n\n\nconvert_data (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nfunction read_data(filename=\"result.yml\")\n    # Read YAML file or string\n    filepath = joinpath(@__DIR__, \"run\", filename)\n    # Parse YAML content\n    parsed_data = YAML.load_file(filepath)\n\n    # Convert data to DataFrame\n    df = convert_data(parsed_data)\n\n    return df\nend\n\n\nread_data (generic function with 2 methods)\n\n\nThe result from SPENVIS is stored in a yaml file.

Use SPENVIS or GEANT-4 for your modeling.\n\nThe energy loss of particles depends on the nature of particles (mass, charge, etc), the incident energy, and the thickness of the Al layer.\nFor the two-layer detector, where the ﬁrst layer is Al and the second layer is Silicon, the thickness of the Al layer varies from 0 nm to 100 nm with the thickness of the Si layer ﬁxed to 2 mm.\nAs shown in Figure 1, heavier ions like O+ deposits more energy in the Al layer than lighter ions like He+ and H+, leading to a smaller energy recorded by the Si layer.\nAnd for O+ with low incoming energy below a certain energy threshold \\(E\\), the recorded deposited energy in Si layer will drop to zero. This threshold energy \\(E\\) depends on the thickness of the Al layer \\(d\\). The thicker the Al layer, the higher the threshold energy.\n\\[E=E(d)\\]\nMore generally, the threshold energy \\(E\\) also depends the incident particle \\(s\\).\n\\[E=E(d,s)\\]\n\n\nCode\nusing Pkg\nPkg.add([\n    \"YAML\",\n    \"DataFrames\",\n    \"Gadfly\",\n    \"Unitful\",\n])\n\nusing YAML\nusing DataFrames\nusing Gadfly\nusing Unitful\n\n\n\n\nCode\nfunction parse_result_line(line)\n    values = split(line, ',')\n    Layer = parse(Int, values[1])\n    Thickness = parse(Float64, values[2])  # Assuming thickness in cm\n    Density = parse(Float64, values[3])    # Assuming density in g/cm3\n    Dose = parse(Float64, values[4])       # Assuming dose in keV\n    Error = try\n        parse(Float64, values[5])\n    catch _\n        NaN\n    end  # Handle '-nan' and other errors\n\n    return (Layer, Thickness, Density, Dose, Error)\nend\n\nfunction convert_data(yaml_data)\n    # Iterate through the data and convert each field\n    for entry in yaml_data\n        entry[\"layer.Al.thickness\"] = parse(Float64, replace(entry[\"layer.Al.thickness\"], \" um\" =&gt; \"\")) * 1000 * u\"nm\"\n        entry[\"source\"][\"energy\"] = parse(Float64, replace(entry[\"source\"][\"energy\"], \" MeV\" =&gt; \"\")) * 1000\n        entry[\"result\"] = [parse_result_line(line) for line in split(entry[\"result\"], '\\n') if line != \"\"]\n    end\n\n    df = DataFrame(\n        IncidentEnergy=[entry[\"source\"][\"energy\"] for entry in yaml_data],\n        DepositedEnergy=[entry[\"result\"][3][4] for entry in yaml_data],\n        SourceParticle=[entry[\"source\"][\"particle\"] for entry in yaml_data],\n        LayerAlThickness=[entry[\"layer.Al.thickness\"] for entry in yaml_data],\n    )\n\n    return df\nend\n\n\nconvert_data (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nfunction read_data(filename=\"result.yml\")\n    # Read YAML file or string\n    filepath = joinpath(@__DIR__, \"run\", filename)\n    # Parse YAML content\n    parsed_data = YAML.load_file(filepath)\n\n    # Convert data to DataFrame\n    df = convert_data(parsed_data)\n\n    return df\nend\n\n\nread_data (generic function with 2 methods)\n\n\nThe result from SPENVIS is stored in a yaml file.

    "text": "Differentiate monoenergetic ions\n\nDemonstrate that with a sufficient number of detectors you could differentiate monoenergetic protons, He+ and O+.\n\nAssuming the Protons constitute \\(n_1\\) percen, He+ \\(n_2\\), and O+ \\(n_3\\) of the incoming beam. For three unknown variables \\(n_1\\), \\(n_2\\), \\(n_3\\), we need at least three detectors to solve the equation system. With the first detector recording the total incoming energy \\(E_1\\), the second detector \\(E_2\\), and the third detector \\(E_3\\), we have the following equation system:\n\\[E_1 = n_1 E + n_2 E + n_3 E\\]\n\\[E_2 = n_1 \\alpha_{2,p} E + n_2 \\alpha_{2,He+} E + n_3 \\alpha_{2,O+} E\\]\n\\[E_3 = n_1 \\alpha_{3,p} E + n_2 \\alpha_{3,He+} E + n_3 \\alpha_{3,O+} E\\]\nwhere \\(\\alpha_{2,p}\\), \\(\\alpha_{2,He+}\\), \\(\\alpha_{2,O+}\\), \\(\\alpha_{3,p}\\), \\(\\alpha_{3,He+}\\), \\(\\alpha_{3,O+}\\) are 1- the energy loss ratio of protons, He+ and O+ in the Al layer of the second and third detector respectively.\nSince \\(\\alpha_{i,p}\\) can be determined from experiment/simulation, we can solve the above equation to get \\(n_1\\), \\(n_2\\), \\(n_3\\).\nIf we want to well differentiate monoenergetic protons, He+ and O+ with energy \\(E\\), we can reverse the relationship \\(E=E(d,s)\\) to get the thickness of the Al layer \\(d\\) for each ion. This is possible because theoretically the threshold energy \\(E\\) is a monotonic increasing function of the thickness of the Al layer \\(d\\).\n\\[d=d(E,s)\\]\nSo for a detector with a thickness \\(d_{O+}=d(E,O+)\\) of the Al layer, we only detect the deposited energy of protons and He+ in the Si layer. And for a detector with a thickness \\(d_{He+}=d(E,He+)\\) of the Al layer, we only detect the deposited energy of protons in the Si layer.\nThen we have additional \\(\\alpha_{2,O+}=0\\) and \\(\\alpha_{3,O+}=\\alpha_{3,He+}=0\\) in the equation system, simplifying the equation system to:\n\\[E_1 = n_1 E + n_2 E + n_3 E\\]\n\\[E_2 = n_1 \\alpha_{2,p} E + n_2 \\alpha_{2,He+} E\\]\n\\[E_3 = n_1 \\alpha_{3,p} E\\]\nTo demonstrate the differentiation, suppose the energy of the incoming beam is \\(E=100\\) keV.\nFrom the Figure 2, we can use the following thickness of the Al layer to differentiate the three ions:\n\n\\(d_{1} = d_{O+} \\approx 300 nm\\)\n\\(d_{2} = d_{He+} \\approx 610 nm\\)\n\nAnd we have \\(\\alpha_{2,p} \\approx 0.59\\), \\(\\alpha_{2,He+} \\approx 0.38\\) and \\(\\alpha_{3,p} \\approx 0.22\\) from the simulation. The equation is solvable.\n\n\nCode\ndf2 = read_data(\"result_2.yml\")\n\n\n15×4

You will use freeware Geant-4 which simulates particle interaction with matter, through a portal: SPENVIS. Various models exist there (very useful site!).\nFirst you have to register, then create a project, then input your model input and output parameters, then make a run and get results one-energy-at-a-time. Once you know how to do that, then you must create an array of inputs and outputs outside of SPENVIS in your favorite plotting package (e.g., excel, python or other). You will then record those results and plot them, one array for protons, another for He+ and another for O+. You can try other species as well, for example O2+ which may be present in the low altitude ionosphere.\n\nAssume monoenergetic beams. The program allows you to use a simple ion spectrum. (For the bonus question you have to make a guess on the instrument response function, model it in a simple analytical form, then prove it can be done using Geant-4. You do not have to do the bonus.)\n\nFor your report, you should not repeat the steps I mention below, but just execute your outline above and go right to the findings, plots and discussion. In the discussion explain how you use the model to design a detector system (how many detectors, thicknesses, orientations etc) that does the job.\n\nOn SPENVIS after registration, name your project and proceed to use Geant-4 “MULASSIS”. You can save your run, and come back to it later.\nYour system will be a 3 layer system, where the first layer is air, the second Al of variable thickness and the third Silicon of a mm or two... enough to stop the highest energy of interest. You shoot some particles (10,000 is a good number), and record how much energy is deposited in Si. Excluding losses in the Si (phonons) the lost energy is mainly due to losses in the Aluminum. Pick the source parameters: How many/which ions, charge angle (-22 deg -&gt; 22 deg).\nFor Geometry you pick the layers above, and for Al choose 0, 1, 10 100 nm, one thickness at a time.\nSpecify the input as monoenergetic beam.\nSpecify analysis parameters as mean energy (the mean energy deposited based on the 10,000 particle run)\nCreate a macro (a bunch of commands that tell Geant-4 what to do) and Run.\nSee the plot\nOutput results (2 numbers) into your program next to input energy to build the in/out energy curve.\nRepeat, one point at a time.\nPlot results for one species and then (in different color) for other species.\nRepeat for different Al thicknesses.",

The noise equivalent magnetic induction (NEMI or sensitivity) of the search-coil antenna is less than or equal to : 2 pT/sqrt(Hz) at 10 Hz, 0.3 pT/sqrt(Hz) at 100 Hz and 0.05 pT/sqrt(Hz) at 1 kHz (Fig. 6). The SCM resolution at 1k Hz is 0.15pT.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.

It mathchs expectation and looks quite like the NEMI from publications : resonance near 1kz with minimum noise level, together with a decreasing noise density at low frequencies, and an increasing noise level at high frequencies.\nFrom the quickplot spectrum, we can see there are some waves of 50-200 Hz between 13:06:50 and 13:07:00. Also observed is weak wave near 800 hz before 13:05:40.\n\n\nCode\ndata = get_data(tvar_tdpwrspc[0], xarray=True)\nquiet_time_data = data.sel(time='2015-10-16T13:06:16')\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\nax.loglog(quiet_time_data.spec_bins.data[0], np.sqrt(quiet_time_data.data[0])*1000)\n\nax.set_xlabel(\"Freq (Hz)\")\nax.set_ylabel(\"NEMI (pT/sqrt(Hz))\")\nplt.show()",

    "text": "Some models for high-energy radiation from compact objects involve gas free-falling onto the surface of the object at a velocity near the object’s escape speed. This speed is very supersonic relative to the star, so the gas must pass through a shock (called either an “accretion” or “standoff” shock) before it settles on the surface.

Magnetic tension oppose such separation, however, such force acts to decrease the angular momentum of the inner fluid element and increase that of the outer element. Because angular momentum is an increasing function of radius in Keplerian disks, this transfer of angular momentum causes the fluid elements to separate further radially, leading to instability. This continuously growing stretching and twisting of magnetic field lines generate MHD turbulence. The turbulent motions effectively act as a efficient “viscous” force, facilitating the transfer of angular momentum.",

This appears to be influenced by electron scattering caused by both whistler-mode and EMIC waves. Interestingly, despite this scattering, the predominant factor remains electron acceleration through whistler-mode waves, largely driven by substorm injections. The increase in electron fluxes during the storm, as recorded by ELFIN and ERG, aligns well with our analytical flux model. The first figure in the paper comprehensively presents all the observations we used, while the concluding figure distinctly shows the impact of electron acceleration on flux enhancement.\n\n\n\n(top) An overview of the mission orbits recorded on April 17, 2021, from 00:00 to 12:00 UTC.

Sufficiently strong injections and chorus wave-driven electron acceleration in the presence of a sufficiently steep negative electron energy PSD gradient can balance such wave-driven losses.\n\n\n\nFuture Work\n\nStatistically study the conditions that lead to relativistic electron flux decay and recovery.\nUnderstand the physical mechanisms that lead to the observed electron flux: strong diffusion or non-linear wave-particle interactions."

Let us take μ = M1M2/(M1 + M2) is the reduced mass and M = M1 + M2 is the total mass. You may assume that both masses are the same, M1 = M2 = 1.4 M⊙, and remain constant as the orbit evolves.

General relativity predicts that the orbit will lose angular momentum due to gravitational waves at a rate: dL dt = − , (5) (You don’t need to derive this!)

This event, observed by NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope, also marked the first detection of the heavy element tellurium from such a merger, highlighting the role of these cosmic events in synthesizing heavy elements.",

    "text": "2 Binary Evolution\nAs a star transfers mass to a nearby compact object, the mass ratio of the system changes, and hence the dynamics will evolve. Here you will examine how this evolution occurs in a low-mass X-ray binary. Let us consider two stars of masses m1 and m2 on circular orbits in a system in which the center of mass is the origin.\n\nA very simple approximation to the Roche lobe radius of star 1, \\(R_{L,1}\\) is\n\n\\[\nR_{L, 1} \\sim \\frac{a}{2}\\left(\\frac{m_1}{m_{\\mathrm{tot}}}\\right)^{1 / 3}\n\\]\nwhere \\(q=M_1 / M_2\\). Show that\n\\[\n\\frac{\\Delta R_{L, 1}}{R_{L, 1}} \\sim\\left(\\frac{5 / 3}{m_1}-\\frac{2}{m_2}\\right) \\Delta m_2\n\\]\nRemember that both \\(a\\) and \\(q\\) change in this situation!\n\nLow-mass stars on the main sequence have a mass-radius relation\n\n\\[\nR \\approx 0.9\\left(\\frac{M}{M_{\\odot}}\\right)^\\alpha R_{\\odot}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\alpha \\approx 0.9\\). Show that the radius of star \\(1, R_{\\star, 1}\\), changes as\n\\[\n\\frac{\\Delta R_{\\star, 1}}{R_{\\star, 1}}=\\alpha \\frac{\\Delta m_1}{m_1}=-\\alpha \\frac{\\Delta m_2}{m_1} .\n\\]\nas it loses mass to its companion.\n\nTo avoid Roche lobe overflow, we need \\(|∆ R_{\\star, 1}| &gt; |∆ R_{L,1}|\\), so that the star shrinks more rapidly than the Roche lobe: otherwise the Roche lobe will shrink so fast that the mass transfer runs away.. Show that this requires \\(q\\le1.3\\). (With the true form of \\(R_L(q)\\), the threshold is slightly smaller.) We thus generally find that the donor star is less massive than the accreting object in X-ray binaries! This is believed to be why there are so few intermediate mass X-ray binaries: mass transfer proceeds very rapidly until the donor star is less massive than the compact object. Hint: Note that \\(∆R_{L,1} &lt; 0\\) if \\(∆m_2 &gt; 0\\); this will affect how to interpret the absolute value signs.",

    "text": "3 Black Hole Mergers\n\nIn the last decade – after many decades of hard work! – physicists have detected gravitational waves from merging stellar mass black holes. These have been quite different from the sources we expected and have raised many questions about stellar mass black holes. Read this article: https://www.quantamagazine.org/colliding-black-holes-tell-new-story-ofstars-20160906/\nSummarize the models for the formation of these systems, and weigh the evidence to determine what you think is the most likely option. (There’s no right answer, though you can find more recent discussions on the internet if you want to see what has been learned since!)\n\n\nCommon-Envelope Evolution (Classic Theory):\n\n\nFormation: A pair of massive stars begins in a wide orbit.\nBlack Hole Formation: Star A collapses into a black hole while Star B grows, further shrinking the orbit. When Star B exhausts its fuel, it also collapses into a black hole. The two black holes, now close, eventually spiral into each other and merge.\nKey Features: This process involves complex interactions with hydrogen envelopes and gas loss, which draw the stars closer.\n\n\nChemically Homogeneous Evolution (New Theory):\n\n\nFormation: Two massive stars in a tight orbit are “tidally locked”. Their rapid spinning stirs the stars, maintaining uniform chemical composition and high internal heat.\nBlack Hole Formation: Unlike most stars, which have distinct core and envelope layers, these stars fuse entirely and contract into compact black holes without shedding much material. The black holes are already close, and their merger happens as they spiral closer due to gravitational waves.\nKey Features: This model skips the envelope phase and results in direct black hole formation in a tight orbit.\n\nThe Chemically Homogeneous Evolution model seems most plausible for explaining the unexpected large masses of black holes in recent mergers. However, the Common-Envelope Evolution might still account for a broader range of scenarios. Future data could favor one model definitively, or they might work in tandem to explain different types of mergers.",

How did you download and plot? Show some lines of the ascii data.\n\nThe AE index (Auroral Electrojet index) and Dst index (Disturbance Storm-Time index) are geomagnetic indices used to measure different aspects of Earth’s magnetic activity. The AE index quantifies the intensity of auroral electrojets, currents flowing in the auroral regions, and is derived from horizontal magnetic field variations measured by magnetometers distributed around the auroral zone. It provides insight into substorm activity and is calculated using the difference between maximum and minimum horizontal components recorded at these stations. The Dst index, on the other hand, measures the intensity of the ring current, a system of charged particles trapped in Earth’s magnetosphere. It is derived from the average horizontal magnetic field variations observed by low-latitude magnetometers. The Dst index is commonly used to assess geomagnetic storms, with negative values indicating stronger disturbances.\nWe use julia to download and plot the AE and Dst indices directly from their official site, WDC-C in Kyoto.\n\nhttps://wdc.kugi.kyoto-u.ac.jp/aeasy/index.html\nhttps://wdc.kugi.kyoto-u.ac.jp/dstae/index.html / http://wdc.kugi.kyoto-u.ac.jp/dst_final/201503\n\nFirst we register and download the data dependencies using the DataDeps package.\n\n\nCode\nusing CairoMakie\nusing DataDeps\nusing CSV, DelimitedFiles\nusing TimeSeries\nusing DataFrames\nusing Dates\n\nregister(DataDep(\"AE Index\",\n    \"\"\"\n    Dataset: AE Index\n    Website: https://wdc.kugi.kyoto-u.ac.jp/aeasy/index.html\n    \"\"\",\n    \"https://wdc.kugi.kyoto-u.ac.jp///aeasy///wwwtmp/WWW_aeasy04087001.dat\"\n))\n\nregister(DataDep(\"Dst Index\",\n    \"\"\"\n    Dataset: Dst Index\n    Website: https://wdc.kugi.kyoto-u.ac.jp/dstae/index.html\n    \"\"\",\n    \"https://wdc.kugi.kyoto-u.ac.jp///dstae///wwwtmp/WWW_dstae04096902.dat\"\n))\n\n# Step 1: Download data\nprintln(\"Downloading AE index data...\")\nae_file = readdir(datadep\"AE Index\", join=true)[1]\n\nprintln(\"Downloading Dst index data...\")\ndst_file = readdir(datadep\"Dst Index\", join=true)[1]\n\n\n┌ Warning: Over-writing registration of the datadep\n│   name = \"AE Index\"\n└ @ DataDeps ~/.julia/packages/DataDeps/Y2lje/src/registration.jl:15\n┌ Warning: Over-writing registration of the datadep\n│   name = \"Dst Index\"\n└ @ DataDeps ~/.julia/packages/DataDeps/Y2lje/src/registration.jl:15\nDownloading AE index data...\nDownloading Dst index data...\n\n\n\"/Users/zijin/.julia/scratchspaces/124859b0-ceae-595e-8997-d05f6a7a8dfe/datadeps/Dst Index/WWW_dstae04096902.dat\"\n\n\nThe data is downloaded as text files in IAGA-2002 format.

How did you download and plot? Show some lines of the ascii data.\n\nThe AE index (Auroral Electrojet index) and Dst index (Disturbance Storm-Time index) are geomagnetic indices used to measure different aspects of Earth’s magnetic activity. The AE index quantifies the intensity of auroral electrojets, currents flowing in the auroral regions, and is derived from horizontal magnetic field variations measured by magnetometers distributed around the auroral zone. It provides insight into substorm activity and is calculated using the difference between maximum and minimum horizontal components recorded at these stations. The Dst index, on the other hand, measures the intensity of the ring current, a system of charged particles trapped in Earth’s magnetosphere. It is derived from the average horizontal magnetic field variations observed by low-latitude magnetometers. The Dst index is commonly used to assess geomagnetic storms, with negative values indicating stronger disturbances.\nWe use julia to download and plot the AE and Dst indices directly from their official site, WDC-C in Kyoto.\n\nhttps://wdc.kugi.kyoto-u.ac.jp/aeasy/index.html\nhttps://wdc.kugi.kyoto-u.ac.jp/dstae/index.html / http://wdc.kugi.kyoto-u.ac.jp/dst_final/201503\n\nFirst we register and download the data dependencies using the DataDeps package.\n\n\nCode\nusing CairoMakie\nusing DataDeps\nusing CSV, DelimitedFiles\nusing TimeSeries\nusing DataFrames\nusing Dates\n\nregister(DataDep(\"AE Index\",\n    \"\"\"\n    Dataset: AE Index\n    Website: https://wdc.kugi.kyoto-u.ac.jp/aeasy/index.html\n    \"\"\",\n    \"https://wdc.kugi.kyoto-u.ac.jp///aeasy///wwwtmp/WWW_aeasy04087001.dat\"\n))\n\nregister(DataDep(\"Dst Index\",\n    \"\"\"\n    Dataset: Dst Index\n    Website: https://wdc.kugi.kyoto-u.ac.jp/dstae/index.html\n    \"\"\",\n    \"https://wdc.kugi.kyoto-u.ac.jp///dstae///wwwtmp/WWW_dstae04096902.dat\"\n))\n\n# Step 1: Download data\nprintln(\"Downloading AE index data...\")\nae_file = readdir(datadep\"AE Index\", join=true)[1]\n\nprintln(\"Downloading Dst index data...\")\ndst_file = readdir(datadep\"Dst Index\", join=true)[1]\n\n\n┌ Warning: Over-writing registration of the datadep\n│   name = \"AE Index\"\n└ @ DataDeps ~/.julia/packages/DataDeps/Y2lje/src/registration.jl:15\n┌ Warning: Over-writing registration of the datadep\n│   name = \"Dst Index\"\n└ @ DataDeps ~/.julia/packages/DataDeps/Y2lje/src/registration.jl:15\nDownloading AE index data...\nDownloading Dst index data...\n\n\n\"/Users/zijin/.julia/scratchspaces/124859b0-ceae-595e-8997-d05f6a7a8dfe/datadeps/Dst Index/WWW_dstae04096902.dat\"\n\n\nThe data is downloaded as text files in IAGA-2002 format.

    "text": "3 Voyager 2 Heliospheric termination shock\n\nVoyager 2 crossed the Heliospheric termination shock and entered the heliosheath in Aug. 2007.\n\n\n3.1 Plot and analysis\n\n[a] Plot the shock crossing in CDAWeb using their own plotting resources. In particular plot the total and RTN components of the magnetic field, flow speed, proton density N, and temperature T. In a short paragraph explain: what is the RTN system and how did you create the plot? In a second paragraph explain if the changes in the above parameters are consistent with shock crossings.\n\nThe RTN (Radial-Tangential-Normal) coordinate system is a heliocentric coordinate system used to describe the position in relation to the Sun fixed at a spacecraft (or the planet): The R axis is directed radially away from the Sun, the T axis is the cross product of the solar rotation axis and the R axis, and the N axis is the cross product of R and T.\n\nWe utilize the combined COHOWeb dataset (VOYAGER2_COHO1HR_MERGED_MAG_PLASMA, https://cdaweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/misc/NotesV.html#VOYAGER2_COHO1HR_MERGED_MAG_PLASMA) (Ness et al. 2023). The plot was generated using “CDAWeb Data Explorer” by selecting the “Plot Data” option and choosing the appropriate data variable. We select time range from 2007/08/01 00:00:00.000 to 2007/09/30 00:00:00.000.\nAround the end of August 31, we observe a significant decrease in bulk flow velocity accompanied by increases in proton density and temperature, corresponding to the shock crossing. Additionally, the magnetic field exhibits a slight increase. These changes are consistent with shock crossings, as shocks typically cause reductions in downstream flow velocity and simultaneous enhancements in plasma density, temperature, and magnetic field strength.\n\n[b] What is the change in pressure, including dynamic pressure, across the shock (assume the crossing is along the shock normal)? To do this also ignore the electron thermal pressure (just use ion thermal pressure) and plot the quantity: N*V^2 + Pt, where Pt is the sum of magnetic and thermal pressures.

    "text": "Introduction - Drift orbit bifurcations\nAt drift orbit bifurcations the particle phase space trajectory crosses a separatrix (Figures 2l and 2m), which divides the (pk, s) phase plane into three distinct regions. The region outside of the separatrix corresponds to the bounce motion across the equator, while two lobes connected at a saddle point correspond to trajectories trapped below and above the equator. While the particle approaches the separatrix its instantaneous bounce period increases logarithmically and in some small vicinity of the separatrix becomes comparable to the drift period.\n\nIn this vicinity the quasiperiodic character of the bounce motion is broken, since the effective potential of the motion there is changing at the time scales of the instantaneous bounce period and can no longer be considered slowly varying. Close to the separatrix the second invariant is therefore not conserved. At two consecutive separatrix crossings corresponding to bifurcations off the equator and back, the invariant exhibits jumps. As a result by the time the particle resumes its motion across the equator it accumulates a nonzero change in the second invariant. Each bifurcation also leads to radial and pitch angle jumps.\n\n\n\n\nSchematic illustration of bifurcating (purple) and stably trapped (green) particle dynamics\n\n\n\nParticles that undergo drift orbit bifurcations (blue color) violate the second invariant J at bifurcations, when the period of the bounce and the drift motions are no longer separated."

Interestingly, at intermediate initial values the average change in the invariant can be negative. The magnitude of jumps in the invariant increases with increase in LM; the larger the daynight asymmetry of the magnetic field, the larger the jumps of the invariant at orbit bifurcations."

    "text": "Long-Term Transport Due to Multiple Bifurcations\n\nMotivated by minimizing computational time as well as deriving a simplified description of radial and pitch angle transport due to bifurcations which can be used in radiation belt models to capture physics of the bifurcation process, we sought a reduced description of transport due to orbit bifurcations. The changes in the invariant I and the radial position LM of a particle due to two drift orbit bifurcations over the course of one drift orbit depend only on three parameters: their initial values and the bounce phase value prior to the bifurcations. Particle transport due to drift orbit bifurcations can therefore be described by a dynamical map relating the change in three state variables \\((θ , I, L_M)\\) over a drift orbit.\n\n\n\n\nRadial transport of radiation belt electrons due to drift orbit bifurcations\n\n\n\\[\n\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\nI_{k+1}=I_k+\\Delta I\\left(\\theta_k, I_k, L_{M k}\\right) \\\\\nL_{M k+1}=L_{M k}+\\Delta L\\left(\\theta_k, I_k, L_{M k}\\right) \\\\\n\\theta_{k+1}=\\theta_k+\\Delta \\theta \\bmod 2 \\pi\n\\end{array}\\right.\n\\]\n\nquantified by 〈(ΔL(t))2〉 of ensemble of particles at different initial values of the second invariant.

Subsequent bifurcations result in broadening of particle distribution along their transport characteristic. After the particle population expands across the whole bifurcation region, the h(DL)2i width stops growing, while the individual particles keep meandering back and forth along the characteristic."

This will give you 3 components: Radially inward, Azimuthal Westward, and Field aligned. Plot and confirm that the compressional component is small.\n\n\nTo confirm that the compressional component of the magnetic field is small, we need to analyze the fluctuations in the magnetic field and determine whether the component along the background field direction is significantly weaker than the perpendicular components.\nfac_matrix_make and rotate could be easily implemented in few lines. Note that we implement only the array version (corresponding to one timestamp), and the matrix version could be freely got using Julia broadcast operators which also align with dimensions.\nfunction fac_matrix_make(\n    vec::AbstractVector;\n    xref=[1.0, 0.0, 0.0]\n)\n    z0 = normalize(vec)\n    y0 = normalize(cross(z0, xref))\n    x0 = cross(y0, z0)\n    return vcat(x0', y0', z0')\nend\n\nfunction rotate(da, mat)\n    da = da[DimSelectors(mats)]\n    da_rot = mats .* eachrow(da.data)\n    TS(dims(da, Ti), dims(da, 2), hcat(da_rot...)')\nend\n\n\nCode\nda = tha_fgs_gse\n# smooth the data\nmat_da = smooth(da, 601)\n# make the rotation matrix from the smoothed data\nmats = fac_matrix_make.(eachslice(mat_da, dims=Ti))\n# rotate original data\nda_fac = rotate(da, mats)\ntplot([da, da_fac])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3 Poloidal vs. toroidal\n\n\nMake dynamic power spectra of the radial and azimuthal components. Which of the two components dominates? This determines if the FLR is poloidal or toroidal. (You may use wavelet transform instead of FFT to construct the dynamic power spectrum, if you prefer and can easily do so as in IDL SPEDAS). Report on your plots with explanations. Show all your code in addition to your plots, with comments included for clarification.\n\n\n\n\nCode\nda_x = da_fac[:, 1]\nda_x = rectify_datetime(da_x)\n\nres_x = pspectrum(da_x, spec1)\nplot_tfr(res_x)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nda_y = da_fac[:, 2]\nda_y = rectify_datetime(da_y)\n\nres_y = pspectrum(da_y, spec1)\nplot_tfr(res_y)\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that the power spectrum of the y (azimuthal) component is much higher than the power spectrum of the x (radial) component. This indicates that the FLR is likely to be toroidal.",
