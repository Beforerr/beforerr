    "text": "Question 2\n\nFor a day/time of interestNote1 from THEMIS or MMS, based on your perusal of the overview plots at the mission website, and using standard tools:\n\nPlot SCM time-series data in 2 different coordinate systems: one that you introduce from L2 files and one you create by rotating the data using cotrans (e.g., GSE and SM coord’s).\nDo a time-series spectrogram of a SCM component in some geophysical coordinates in survey and burst mode up to a high frequency, several kHz (use waveburst from THEMIS or “hb” from MMS).\nSelect a time when the geophysical signal (plasma waves) is at minimum (a quiet period) by looking at the dynamic power spectrum first. Compare the quiet time spectrum (a line spectrum) plot with published instrument noise curves: Point out the characteristic noise curve, a decreasing noise density as a function of frequency at low frequencies, a minimum near the resonance, and an increasing noise level at high frequencies – does it match expectation? Can you point out the plasma waves in the dynamic power spectrum?\n\nNote1: A good day for THEMIS is the first results Space Sci. Rev. paper (2007-03-23 13-16UT,) or the first Science paper (2008-02-26 4- 6UT) from any THEMIS spacecraft. A good day for MMS is the first Science paper (2015-10-16 13:00-14:00UT) from any MMS spacecraft.\n\nWe choose MMS for this question.

The noise equivalent magnetic induction (NEMI or sensitivity) of the search-coil antenna is less than or equal to : 2 pT/sqrt(Hz) at 10 Hz, 0.3 pT/sqrt(Hz) at 100 Hz and 0.05 pT/sqrt(Hz) at 1 kHz (Fig. 6). The SCM resolution at 1k Hz is 0.15pT.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.

It mathchs expectation and looks quite like the NEMI from publications : resonance near 1kz with minimum noise level, together with a decreasing noise density at low frequencies, and an increasing noise level at high frequencies.\nFrom the quickplot spectrum, we can see there are some waves of 50-200 Hz between 13:06:50 and 13:07:00. Also observed is weak wave near 800 hz before 13:05:40.\n\ndata = get_data(tvar_tdpwrspc[0], xarray=True)\nquiet_time_data = data.sel(time='2015-10-16T13:06:16')\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\nax.loglog(quiet_time_data.spec_bins.data[0], np.sqrt(quiet_time_data.data[0])*1000)\n\nax.set_xlabel(\"Freq (Hz)\")\nax.set_ylabel(\"NEMI (pT/sqrt(Hz))\")\nplt.show()"
